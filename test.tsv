He’s not “hating”. The dude explicitly said 2016, so he responded with “prime isn’t 1 year”.  Why is this sub so defensive about Curry?  This is just logic. If someone uses one year as evidence, the other person will respond with one year.	1

he was being fouled on drives and they weren't calling it, plain and simple. if it happens today he starts shooting and bitching but in 2011 he had played the role of villain (which he isn't comfortable being) and just kind of shut down and tried to facilitate.   wade took 15% more shots and got 150% more FTA, bosh took 1% more shots and shot 140% more FTA  lebron's FTA were 2/4/4/4/2/4  his FGA were 16/15/14/11/19/15  he took half his shots inside 10' and actually got most of his FTA on shots OUTSIDE 10' which is fucking weird and has probably never happened to him since  #chalmers got 3 more FTA on half as many shots and he only took 9 shots inside 10'  but someone had to pay the price for the mavs getting fucked in 2006 and who better than the league's newly crowned supervillain  on the other end, lebron got called for 20 fouls, the most on the heat and the 2nd most overall (chandler 24)  it was just a weird series and the only thing he could have done was make bombs. up until that point of his career, he was 31/190 for 16% on deep 3s  after that point he's 85/258 for 33% on deep 3s and that's above the league average (the last 4 years he's become ELITE at long 3s, going 69/179 for 39% which is at the top of the NBA)  he evolved to prevent that scenario from happening again. elite players evolve or they don't stay elite for long.	0

I actually did answer his question just in another comment chain right below it. And just for the record you shouldn't brush off what are very clear signs of mental unease in your comments.  A living wage is one in which a person working 40 hours a week can afford all the necessities (shelter, clothing, a phone, health care, etc.) as well as have enough left over at the end of the month for an emergency fund (so that you can actually take a breath that isn't tainted by the pressure of wondering what happens if you miss just one paycheck and maybe not be terrified about your financial situation every waking second).   THAT is a living wage. It will be different depending on the state and even city, and not everyone will be diligent about saving, but what I outlined isn't outrageous or impossible.	1

Sorry but you should inform yourself on the situation. I'm a Nursing student, all you said was just plain wrong. More exposure means more cases, this virus spreads quite easily and it takes 2 weeks to for it to act, so there will be infected people that without knowing will be infecting others. Plus, the more cases in the Hospital, the worse it gets in there and it doesn't mean outside the Hospital the situation is better, because it likely isn't. The bigger the strain on the Hospitals, the likelier it is that health care providers will become infected and will have to be treated or quarantined themselves, putting an even bigger strain on the Hospital.  Just stay home when you can. You don't know who's infected and if you're already infected, so don't go out infecting others.	0

"I'll get back to you on that.   I wouldn't call it a full-on admission, but that statement was definitely wonky as hell; ""I didn't rape her, but also, she's not lying when she says that I did"". It sounds like whoever wrote it was trying to come off as sympathetic instead of the standard deny-deny-deny, but it does leave a bad taste in my mouth.   Though, so does the fact that she refused to testify and dropped the criminal case in favor of a civil suit. It's a toss up until I reread some of the transcripts so I can cite actual info. I recall not believing her but I like to believe that my views are constantly being broadened, so idk yet"	0

"> You think there's absolutely no reason for former teammates to dissipate contraversy with diplomatic responses? When did you start watching sports?  He can give a diplomatic response without giving him a glowing recommendation and absolving him of all blame.  > I never said dlo was better, I said they were comparable. As in they're both inferior guards who will never contend for championships as the main piece. At the end of the day I'm sure the Celtics would have rather had dlo than Kyrie Irving, the Celtics would rather have an inferior kemba walker than Kyrie too.  And again, they aren’t comparable in any way. I promise you the Celtics would rather have Kyrie than DLo and Kemba. In fact they tried re-signing Kyrie even *after* all the drama. They only settled on Kemba after Kyrie chose the Nets.  > Where are your ""facts""? You provided anecdotes and opinions and absolutely no facts.  Fact: Kyrie is much better at basketball than DLo  Fact: Tatum and Brown’s progression is natural and not a cause of Kyrie being gone  Fact: Not a single front office in the league would choose DLo over Kyrie  > And no, me calling you an idiot is not me being personally invested. I'm just calling you an idiot. Get over it.  If you’ve gotten upset enough that you have to hurl insults, it means you’ve taken it personally as opposed to having a basketball discussion.  > Again, if you don't think Kyrie caused locker room issues with the Celtics last year (issues in Brooklyn and Cleveland too), I dunno what to tell you.

"These facts gonna blow your mind -    - NBA Logo of Jerry west is actually tilted, if it was his natural motion angle, he would fall    - Washington bullets changed their name, not because ""bullet"" sounded bad, but because Bucks had a big problem with it    - Pink uniform is forbidden    - NBA has an agreement with world robotics association, that a game between robots and humans will be played in 2050    - There is already a technology for directing a ball's flight, used for entertainment purposes when fans shoot half court shots. It involves magnets    - It is highly rumored that Jason Kidd was replaced with a look-alike during 2009 season    - 2002 WCF was rigged    - Wilt Chamberlain's stats are overblown and incorrect"	1

Dray is significantly more important to the Warriors success than Klay is though.  He is a much better defender(in a more important role on defense) and is their main playmaker after Steph.	0

r/NBA has a good chunk of fans who think it’s funny to just shit on someones personal life. Dwight was falsely accused of that shit sometime ago and if you check out that thread its everyone just clowning Dwight.   Everyone wants to be seen “socially progressive and woke” but then turn around and absolutely shit on the guy, he never said anything to anyone, didnt speak against anyone but for no reason is the butt of so many immature and ignorant jokes.	1

"[https://www.np.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/ezytd9/reasons\_that\_john\_paxson\_gar\_forman\_need\_to\_go/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/ezytd9/reasons_that_john_paxson_gar_forman_need_to_go/)  So without further ado, here are my reasons Garpax need to go:  In no particular order  * Cristiano Felicio Contract. He was 25 years old averaging 4 and 4. * Waiving Spencer Dinwiddie in favor of Michael Carter-Williams * Trading Tony Snell for Michael Carter-Williams * Letting Spencer Dinwiddie walk in favor of MCW * John Paxson choking Vinny Del Negro (His own hire), he would later be quoted ""What also disappointed me was that VDN never owned up to making a mistake"" * Fired Scott Skiles on Christmas Eve * Fired Bill Cartwright days after Thanksgiving after giving him mismatched rosters and under-preforming * Overruling This lobbying for Draymond Green to draft Marquis Teague * Refused or failed to take back salary and gather assets preferring to bet on player Development in Jabari Parker & Otto Porter JR * Tyrus Tomas for LaMarcus Aldridge * The biggest free agent signing of their tenure they almost immediately started drama with telling him he was no longer allowed to wear a headband. This policy would appear to be reverted years later w/ no explanation * Interviewed no one for the job of Head Coach but Jim Boylen & hired him. Worse several reporters (For example Vinny Goodwill) have alleged that this was like to have been planned since the summer beforehand. * Blindsided Hoiberg by firing him after showing up expecting to run practice. During his tenure here they fed him a steady stream of their personal projects & mandated them to receive playing time. None of these projects worked out. Examples are Jerian Grant, Cameron Payne, Joffrey Lavergne, Zipser, Felicio, etc. * Leaked that Derrick Rose was healthy to the media putting a ton of pressure on him to return in time for the playoffs & launching a wave of jokes that never really let up * Let Ron Adams go from Thibs Staff angering him & resulting in him going on to be the architect of the Warriors championship defense. He now has 3 rings. * Not trading Pau Gasol in 2015-16 where we would miss the playoffs and he would walk for nothing * Ran such a sloppy situation around Thibs firing that word reached Thibodeau Hoiberg would be his likely replacement while he was still coaching the team. Also serious speculation that this was told to players, undermining his authority as coach. * Thibs even being hired is a win for them right? No, they actually didn't want him. Tom Thibodeau was the recommendation of an outside group hired by Reinsdorf. John Paxson wanted Doug Collins and Gar Forman wanted Mike Brown. * Refused to hire Thibs strength & conditioning coach (Anthony Falsone) in Houston. He would later be hired and win the championship with the San Antonio Spurs in 2013-14. He still serves as their athletic director today. * Escorted Thibs out with security when he was fired. * Overpaid Fred Hoiberg 5 years /25 million and then fired him before it was complete. K.C. Johnson has speculated this is the reason why Jim Boylen remains. As, they don’t want to be paying two coaches not coaching at the same time. * Letting a lot of talent walk for nothing. To avoid the headache of having to defend each and every player in this group I’ll make my case for the best and attach the rest as honorable mentions. Omer Asik is the biggest mistake. We had no backup 5 to replace him and Houston ended up getting an almost lottery pick for him later on so he was definitely moveable if we ever wanted out. Honorable mentions: Deng, Marco, E’Twaun, the Bench mob. * Amnestied Carlos Boozer way too late to be able to matter * Leaked that Kris Dunn apparently wasn’t working hard enough over the summer * Failed to see the writing on the wall and instead of rebuilding committed us to that meaningless three alphas year just to do the same thing in the end. * The entire Doug McDermott situation can be made into like eight bullets and is stupidly controversial among Bulls fans. But I know there will be stans in the comments so I will let them defend Garpax. * Trading 17 & 18 for 11 in the 2013 draft  \*Using #11 to draft Doug Mcderrmott in a good draft.  * Dumping Doug Mcderrmott just two years later for basically nothing. * Were incredibly late to the game of analytics, frequently downplaying its importance. * Kevin O’ Connor speculates that their promising to draft Chandler Hutchison restricted us from doing any draft night trades involving the #22 pick in 2018. Started our rebuild by selling a second- round pick. (We know Jordan Bell isn’t good, that’s never what this was about) * Third largest market in the NBA, paid the luxury tax twice. Traded for OPJ whose making 27 million and has played in 24/78 games available. If his girlfriend is reliable he’s also not a fan of the front office and a free agent in a year. * Horrible medical team. We’re always injured every single year. * Rosters frequently have big holes and they take bizarre steps to fix them. No Small Forward? Jabari. Need a long-term scoring option next to Rose? 33-year-old Rip Hamilton seems like a safe bet. (I love Rip but that doesn’t make it a good signing) Need a solid starting ball-handler & playmaker? Tomas Satorasnky, MCW, Jerian, Rondo seems like the wait maybe nvm. I know that you can’t nail every signing and not even all of these are bad. It’s more that there seems to be consistent gaps between how they evaluate talent & fit and that actually translates to the court. * 5 Playoff Series wins total in a 17-year tenure. * Had a Bulls doctor question Luol Deng about sitting out of games for a broken leg. * Dumped John Salmons and a first & second round pick to chase Lebron and ended up with nothing. * Trading Kirk Hinrich during his farewell tour for basically nothing. * Again, overruling Thibs when he liked Rudy Gobert for Tony Snell * Pulled the QO on David Nwaba for Jabari Parker. I feel like Nwaba while maybe not fantastic on his own fit really well with us. We’ve been a worse team since he left. * Misused Lauri basically his entire time here. Maybe not directly because of this but it’s now being rumored that he wants out. * Traded Taj Gibson in a year we made the playoffs for Cameron Payne & Joffrey Lavergne. * Failing to net any assets at the 2020 trade deadline. * IMO have had serious questions regarding their drafting ability since now Orlando Magic assistant GM left in 2012. * Are alleged to use the media to trash players and coaches by [Van Gundy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I4Y4VyDqrs)  ETA: - Dwade contract  * Couldn't build around Jimmy * Bad player development, everyone is regressing save Zach * Had coaches spy on coaches/players (Randy Brown) * Failed to make Chicago a FA destination * Inherited the prestige Jordan gave us, made us a joke. * Threatening to give Jimmy Butlers minutes to Tony Snell when he refused a contract extension."	0

">that this series was guided by refs is a widely-held opinion (that many have reinforced when they rewatch)  Shut the fuck up about my flair, dude. It's lame. And it's obvious I'm not claiming it was just you so idk what you're talking about  And it is a widely held opinion by mavericks fans mostly, check some videos about unbiased reviews from the series and you'd see many people realizing that other than G5, most of the ""phantom"" calls are way overblown. I bet you won't tho   Remember, bad officiating =/= rigging   Its funny that we have compilations of every bad calls from every other series, except 06. Again, you literally cannot make an argument that the refs guided G3, G4, G6. G5 was an anomaly, sure"	0

It’s so funny how no one can show how this series was rigged they show no footage of fouls that were phantom calls. That one foul in game 5 people think was a phantom foul was actually a legit wrist slap and grab once you saw the other angle.   This is the one narrative where mob mentality just rules there’s no way to convince these mouth breathers that the Mavericks just couldn’t defend wade. And their own coach said the strategy was to foul instead of give free layups. Please watch the second link for the dom2k video before spewing some bs	0

Duncan robinson is not a rookie. He is a 2nd year player who shot 28% 3pt in his rookie year. Shot 44% from 3pt this year and is averaging 13ppg. Curry averaged 19ppg in his 2nd year and shot 44% so stop hating and appreciate greatness.. it gets a lot harder once u are an established shooter. Im sure duncan robinson may not shoot 30% if he gets to take the kind of shots curry takes. Even iguodala said he can never teach his kid to shoot like curry because its more of a gift than something u can learn. He just has amazing hand eye coordination. Plays pingpong very well, golfs very well. Could play pro golf if he wanted to. Bowls amazingly , throws perfect darts.

Scottie didn’t have to be that elite to get them over the hump. They needed other defensive options to cover for their lack of a true defensive center imo.

No the bigger problem there was Asians across the country came out in masses to justify Peter Liang's murder of an unarmed innocent Black Man, using the excuse that White Officers get away with it so Asian cops should to. That was very dehumanizing, and you never seen Black Americans do that kind of thing as a collective to any group. Asians here in the United States have a long rap sheet of Anti Black American culture and behavior as a collective. Yet Foundational Black Americans been their main supporters since mass immigration became a thing in the 1970s. Again if White People came out in masses to support a White cop murdering a innocent Black Man, we would called them White Supremacist/Neo Nazis, Lynch Mobs, you name it. So why is it OK for Asians to do that? Yet they cry about Racism when White Supremacist turn on them? Again, don't cry to us Foundational Black Americans. Fight your own battle. Stop running to us whenever White Supremacist starts attacking them. Because any other time the Asian community seem to as a collective be perfectly fine with White Supremacy when the victim is Black. Again hold your own pair.	0

Because the dudes extremely racist towards asians  Edit:  really downvoted?  On February 28, 2001, an Asian American Golden State Warriors’ fan named Michael Ching shouted at Jason (who was playing for the Sacramento Kings) to “get used to sitting on the bench.” However, the third-year NBA player lashed back with immensely inappropriate and racist comments, including, “I’ll shoot all you Asian mother——-. Do you remember the Vietnam War? I’ll shoot all ya’ll like that.” That is after asking Ching if he was a “fag” and calling him a “slant eyed mother——.”   Asshole literally have to give an public apology for being racist and was fined, but I guess its just ok if its against asians, it is reddit after all so he fits in well here  [Source](https://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/williams-apologizes-for-slurs-1.260572)	0

> You didn’t explain anything  Wrong. You've had multiple people (me included) explain to you how it was evident Curry was injured even in the OKC series even from just looking at his movement on the court compared to how he ws moving in the regular season. I also explained to you that the commentators themselves noted it.  > Lying again? The only person I called a child was you   Bruh... You accuse me of lying and then in the very next sentence you admit to the very thing you accused me of lying about... Thanks for proving my point I guess? This is hilarious lmao.   I didn't say you called multiple people children. I said whenever you get called out your only responses are: calling them a child/raging about how they dont watch basketball.  **I find it really funny how much you love to call others children when they correctly call you out for having an incorrect opinion, because there's one of two things happening here.**  **Either you are actually a kid still in high school (and thus you're just projecting your own insecurities onto others), or you really are older than that (and you just have the reading comprehension and mental faculties of someone much younger)?**  **But neither of those scenarios are anything to be proud of lol.**	0
The Rockets defense is good when they try which is a good sign for the playoffs.   It's funny how different defenses rank when you filter out bad teams from the equation and look at defenses vs top ~15 offenses. Some at the top shoot down, others lower ranked shoot up. Rockets are good they just dont always beat bad teams when they're supposed to.   Bucks, for example, go from the #1 overall defense to the #8 defense against the top 15 offenses,  Utah goes from #8 to #17. Rockets go from #15 to #10, which isn't amazing but for what their offense is rated that's really good to improve that much on D vs top offenses   Harden's D is actually insane now too, which is almost certainly because Russ takes a lot of his offensive energy expenditure	1

It’s because you didn’t absolutely agree with him or her. There is no middle ground for these people. I see your point.   I use to use no homo all the time as a kid,.I stopped using it because it was the fad of the joke died, not because it’s offensive.   Something that is offensive that everyone used before was “faggot” or “that was gay”, and yes those phrases would be deemed offensive nowadays.	1
"Honestly I've never gotten that connotation from the use of it if it's used ""correctly"". It's just pointing out that something being said literally sounds gay lol. It isn't homophobic to me at all unless you REALLY go out of your way to use it on things that don't even make sense. Is it kinda lame these days? Sure, but that's a different thing.  I'm not someone who ever really used it, but it's a far cry from saying fag or something."	0

Reply to any point in my other comment here, I’ll post it again, Below. Why weren’t they good enough to get 2nd seed with just MJ and role players, to avoid the pistons? Was it that mj needed what pippen later provided? Who knows. Also  Rookie Scottie in the playoffs averaged 26 minutes in there 3-2 win in the first round. I never said Scottie was better as a rookie, than cj is now. More so I’m talking about team fit not individual talent. The bulls needed someone who could raise their overall defense to elite, given mjs dominance in volume on offense and defense. Pippen provided that bump at the time. CJ alone doesn’t raise the teams at both ends in the same way. With MJ, they didn’t need a lot pieces to compete, but they still needed pieces.	1

"I got your point but the comparison was wacky, and with your clarification I think we can agree ""admirable"" is mostly subjective to which party you vote for but even if I concede he isn't admirable, he's effective and that's what's most important to me and many voters.  Not at all. There's good reason we don't utilize an overall popular vote, middle America wouldn't have their voices heard. It's just that those markets usually A. Have more people per capita than the vast majority of the country and B. Aren't diverse politically.  In fairness half of the country doesn't vote so we can't for sure say one way or the other.

As someone in finance, but also intensely dislike Ferttita because how cheap he is with the Rockets, I understand where he’s coming from. He may have the label of $4.5bn, but his businesses are extremely cash flow poor now. He’s already levered to the hilt from buying the Rockets, and no bank is going to lend him even more money to help pay for employees.   I hope he does the right thing and can find the cash to pay for the workers, OR even better, if the US govt can steal a play from the UK and offer to reimburse 80% of furloughed worker’s wage. That would make a true difference to the economy.	1

People here seem to have totally forgotten about the incident but little do they know China's CCTV has broadcasted zero NBA games this season and their online broadcaster Tencent has also stopped broadcasting games starting Jan 1, 2020. Now the only way to watch NBA in China is via illegal streams.  On a side note, the biggest basketball online forum in China literally removed their sub forum for Houston Rockets and they are pretending that NBA only has 29 teams. During their all star prediction Harden was completely ignored as if he got kidnapped by aliens and never existed on the planet it is actually comical.   Edit: I have been told by other redditors that Tencent has resumed broadcasting the games, except for the rockets games of course. They are sent to the shadow realm. CCTV remains the same and is not broadcasting any NBA games.	1

"You can see him thinking about kicking his leg out to draw a foul from three once in a while and the look on his face is just ""nah, I'm just gonna make sure I drain this bucket instead"" and he just buries it. The fact that he is averaging more over the past six games than Harden has ever averaged over even just three games without needing to draw fouls to do it is a testament to Dame's greatness as a player, it makes every point matter more, it makes you hold your breath the whole game and I bet anything it drags the Blazers to the playoffs.

"And I'll also admit even I'm uncomfortable/uncertain with the idea of someone under 18 having gender changing surgery and I don't fully know where I stand, though I would side on the side of ""lets listen to medical professionals and what they have to say"".  But it drives me nuts that Wade simply says he will call his daughter she/her and she has a feminine name now is enough for people to leap to all those conclusions.  What he did should be the default reaction. Calling someone by a different name/pronoun is easy and reversible if this is something his daughter goes back on later in life.

Time to ban large gatherings.  This is NOT your seasonal flu. 20% of those that get COVID-19 require hospitalization and 15% require supplementary oxygen.     The transmission rate is also significantly higher at 3 to 7 for every one person infected. Flu is super small compared to that.  Only reason numbers are not bigger is because states has NOT been testing like other countries. Only 500 tests done vs 30000 in South Korea and 20000 in Italy.  Can't find infected without tests.  And young people with no underlying conditions have died, death rate is 2%.  Not to mention you do not know long term effects, given its been shown to attack kidneys and other organs.  And if you have hospitals overwhelmed and over capacity there is no where to get help for any illness!!!	1

Because the dudes extremely racist towards asians  Edit:  really downvoted?  On February 28, 2001, an Asian American Golden State Warriors’ fan named Michael Ching shouted at Jason (who was playing for the Sacramento Kings) to “get used to sitting on the bench.” However, the third-year NBA player lashed back with immensely inappropriate and racist comments, including, “I’ll shoot all you Asian mother——-. Do you remember the Vietnam War? I’ll shoot all ya’ll like that.” That is after asking Ching if he was a “fag” and calling him a “slant eyed mother——.”   Asshole literally have to give an public apology for being racist and was fined, but I guess its just ok if its against asians, it is reddit after all so he fits in well here  [Source](https://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/williams-apologizes-for-slurs-1.260572)	0

"I hate doing this, and I'm sorry if it's slightly off-subject in the sense it isn't related to the NBA, but I just want to get this message out in case it protects anyone else (or their mothers) from comas and ventilators: Please do not shop at Mattress Firms across the country (USA) until this is over. It is not a sanitary - and therefore safe - environment to put yourself in during the current ongoing pandemic.   Local leadership in my area made this and asked us to post it to social media:  https://imgur.com/EWSJKr  No matter how sarcastic or tongue-in-cheek that image must seem, I assure you, it's not. :(  They held a video conference yesterday (3/24) advising all employees that even in the event the government specifically declares them as NOT exempt from a shelter in place order, they will challenge it.  Because the corporate honchos in Houston know more than the governments, scientists, and doctors around the world urging people to stay home and flatten the curve.  As part of the official company response, we have been instructed to post ""cleaning logs"" around the store that we sign to ""prove"" we clean the stores twice a day.   Cleaning supplies are low and none are available in local grocery stores. Corporate gave everyone a $50 credit for Office Depot online, which has also been OOS on everything. When asked on the conference call what to do when the supplies available do run out, we were told to ask our DMs to buy some locally.  Think about how many beds and pillows the average customer touches and lays on while picking out a new bed. And then please consider the staggering amount of Lysol/ Clorox cans a store would need to have stocked up in the back to constantly sanitize each and every surface that is touched. Granted, we do offer pillow protectors - that are kept stacked in an open-to-the-air box and touched by every single guest who goes to grab one. Now finally ask yourself if you still feel like that is a truly sanitary environment to shop in right now?  Don't worry though, there's some great news! If you get sick while working this essential position, you get unpaid furlough and no disaster/emergency pay. Also they froze accrued PTO so no sick pay either. But they can't get supplies out to these essential businesses and employees to keep them sanitized and safe to work in.   It's not only unethical, I believe it is (or at least should be) illegal. They are actively fighting against flattening the curve just so they don't lose even more sales than they already have."	0

>presumption that it would BE SAFE FOR PLAYERS/PERSONNEL TO BE THERE. he’s just countering lebron’s take where he said he wouldnt play without fans present. jay’s just saying that in light of all of america having to acclimate and adjust in some seriously sad and extreme ways, with many losing their jobs, homes, and loved ones, NBA players should feel compelled to acclimate as well, and to give people something to hold onto as soon as its absolutely safe to do so, even if that means coming back before fan attendance is allowed and playing in a new and likely non-optimal atmosphere.   >   >god i swear you nephews need to learn to WATCH/READ THE WHOLE DAMN VIDEO/ARTICLE whenever theres an inflammatory headline like this because nine outta ten times its total misleading bullshit  Jesus.

"Attention ""why is it racist LOL?"" idiots: no one reasonable disputes where this comes from. China is guilty of really shitty things, including trying to cover up this virus to begin with, and I would never defend them in a thousand years.  But this Lin quote isn't about about their corrupt gov't. It's about actual Asian people, especially those living in the US, who are now the target of violent hate crimes across the country despite having nothing to do with the virus or China.  Brown people got similar treatment post-9/11, we should be better than that as a society 19 years later. Thinking there's nothing to see here is just being willfully blind because _you_ aren't the target."	1
Lol you retards really don’t understand economics at all. The “economy” is the sum of a society’s transactions. No transactions means no money in the hands of many. Money becomes meaningless if it’s not distributed. Products stop being produced since their is no profit incentive. You thought people were hoarding TP now? Wait until it’s stop being produced at all and now it’s a game of who has a gun. By the way medical facilities are gonna be 20x more over run when people don’t have access to basic products and nutrition.

Lol, you’re fucking ridiculous. I am just stating a fact, not whining at all. I don’t give a shit if anyone makes white jokes. And I would never use the n word you piece of shit.

I don’t have a fucking racist bone in my body, but people like your bitch ass have to assume that based off of a simple statement like I made because you’re incapable of having a fucking conversation. Everyone’s racist that disagrees with you aren’t they? When the fuck did I say that I was a victim of racism, or anything even remotely close to that? You’re the sensitive little cunt who jumped to racism over a very, very, very simple statement. I don’t do Twitter because it’s full of hateful people like you, and pieces of cunt lint like yourself bring out the worst in me.

Unpopular opinion, but Nash doesn't recieve the praise he should because of the Dantoni system and because he is white.

"Lillard waving goodbye  a lot of people are just listing ""great shots"", which to me is a totally different thing than a ""go fuck yourself"" shot.  It needs to be a shot that is probably the wrong play statistically, but you're irrationally confident about because you disrespect your opponent. Lillard embodied that more than almost anyone I've ever seen with his waiting out the shot clock and heaving up a contested long range shot and immediately trolling the opposing team."	1

Whats all these sucking lebrons nuts.. Lebron assembled his team..he is supposed to be the chosen one and went up against an inexperienced warriors team that didnt believe they could win in 2015. Warriors were test running their team in 2015 with the hope of making a championship run in 2016.in 2015 finals game 1 that kyrie played , cavs lost. Cavs went on to win games 2 and 3 without kyrie and lebron fuelling the fact that dellevadova was the reason curry missed shots and was mocking him.. now curry lit them up in games 4,5 and 6 then he started shouting he didnt have help..Kd only copied what lebron did by going to the warriors.. micheal beat everybody in his path.. Lebron only cries foul if the deck isnt stacked in his favor..	0

My dude you are a clown. You posted blatantly wrong information that the tallest player is the “de facto center” as if there’s no difference between middle school basketball and pro hoops. Who plays center and what skills they possess varies for every team and what they want. Ya it’s usually the tallest player, but you were just calling dudes a center because they are the tallest. It’s also awesome how one of the sources you credit, outside of the wiki page that only has information any 6th grade who’s seen a basketball game would know, is basically “trust me I know what I’m talking about”, like you Just discovered a new element because you know that centers are tall.  I disregarded the rest of your “argument” because it’s nonsense, you can’t be older than 14, nobody needed you to write 3 paragraphs to try to prove that centers are tall lmao all anyone was saying is that center is a position usually played by the tallest player, but to say the tallest player is the “de facto center” is just outright wrong especially in the nba.   Lastly, I’m going to guess that you play center because you have some sort of strange fondness for the position itself. They’re the “baddest” lmao nobody harder then Sean Bradley or Robin Lopez	0

Doubt you will look into this, you'll probably just keep your head in the sand. 2009, 4g roll out. Swine Flu outbreak. 3g rolled out in 2001 - SARS outbreak 2002. Radio towers massively rolled out. Radio towers massively rolled out in 1910 - Spanish Flu outbreak in 1912.   5G rolled out....first in Wuhan China. 2nd in Spain. Third in Italy. Then the US (major port cities..NY, LA, Seattle).   Do you see a pattern? It may be nothing, but it is absolutely a pattern worth looking at.  The WHO seems radio frequency radiation as carcinogenic.  5G is used in WEAPON SYSTEMS for crowd control. 5G Network Uses Same EMF Waves As Pentagon Crowd Control System. ... Among the many potential problems with exposure to 5G radio waves are issues with the skin, which is interesting when you consider that this technology is already being used in the military for crowd control purposes.

"He's portraying a situation in which the homophobia affecting the NBA disproportionately originates from POCs. This may or may not be true.  I'm pointing out that many white people are also homophobic, and I'm asserting that religion is the most common thread for homophobes, not ""un-whiteness"".   I don't necessarily see the value of, for example, lumping Chinese Buddhist fans in with Catholic Latino fans as ""the POC population"" while ignoring evangelical whites who, believe it or not, *do* watch the NBA.  I just don't think the way he dissected it is necessarily the most reasonable way to do so."	1

I guess it is the purpose of this post, use the gravity argument to tell us KD scoring was just Steph impact or Steph was just the most impactful player. KD doesnt need Steph to score 50 points. And if you think KD is an afterthought go look at what Lou Williams and Pat Bev said about defending KD in this series. Every top point god has that type of gravity, the problem is that they don't have a playmaker like Draymond to make them pay. Just take James harden and Lilliard. Harden get double team all the team but when he gives the ball to Tucker, the ball stays stuck and there is no action. Or take Lilliard against the pelicans in the playoffs, he got double teamed all serie by jrue and rondo, and when he gives the ball nobody knows how to move the ball to find the open man. So those plays that draymond does ain't easy and few power forwad can make it. So this gravity is effective also because of draymond ability to make each time the right play.  I am sure Steph gravity is a real thing but don't tell me he was the best player in this serie.	0

">Yet another monumentally moronic quote. Literally no GM thinks this way. They are doing their best to build contending teams. And you can find players capable of being good first options without being ""a top 5 player"". It's an asinine argument that you continue to make, and continue to be dead wrong on.  Prove it, history doesn't lie, they build with the best players they can get, there is always a 1-5% chance they can win without a top 5 player or one of their players develops into a top 5 talent due to being young. Keep ignoring statistics though. Why do you think the 3 favourites this year all have top 5 players on them? ofc teams like Miami, Boston etc could get to the ECF, but there is a tiny chance they win, its literally 3/40(if you are generous and count dirk and wade)  >I've said plenty, and refuted almost every one of your moronic arguments.

"Oh my god, this is getting embarassing for you.  > He literally used Stockton and Curry as the examples and gave examples of how different models would effect the outcomes, and it works perfect opposite of how you think it does. The literal calculation has Stockton far and away better and its only after applying the statistical model that gives greater weight to higher achieving individual seasons that Curry jumps up the rankings.  You do realize that this is with a new model that weights longevity even more heavily at it's base right (even before the corrections to the curve)...   You do realize that the guy who made these models himself does not use that one for his top 40 list, precisely because it's even less accurate than the original model right...  Why do you think Curry is ranked higher than Stockton in his top 40, that was updated in 2019, despite him exploring this new (innacurate) model in 2018? C'mon kid, use your head for once.  > In other words, exactly what I said at the start of the conversation and exactly opposite of what you claimed it did.  Except it's not. You're confusing the experimental model's data with the original model's (which is what I made used to back up my claims), you fucking buffoon.  How do you get so confused so often? That's been a consistent theme for you in this thread. Looooooooooooooooool.  > still have yet to read the article.  You do see the irony in this right?  > We both know you didn't actually read that shit  Funny, since you clearly didn't read my comments.  What's defensible about:   > West still had the ball in his hands more than Goodrich, especially during the prime of West's career when he played like 40 minutes a game. Goodrich didn't handle the ball as much as West until the 70 season when he returned to the Lakers  You still don't understand that having the ball in your hands doesn't make you a point guard.   Maybe that's why you turned tail and ran away from this:  *More ignorance. Being a score first guard doesn't preclude you from being a point guard, and handling the ball more/averaging more assists than a PG doesn't imply that you're a PG.*  *LeBron handles the ball (and averages more assists) than many point guards. Larry Bird did too. They were both better pure passers than the majoirty of PGs, and yet they are considered small forwards. Harden and Jokic handle the ball a ton and also average more assists than most PGs. Should we consider them PGs instead of SG and C then? Of course not.*  *For more than half of West's career, he played alongside Gail Goodrich. They were both combo guards and could play both positions, so that's where the confusion comes from. Some people say West was the PG and Goodrich was the SG, but most (in my experience) have West as the SG. There's a reason you see Jerry West on all-time SG rankings more often than you do on PG rankings.*  *For example, ESPN has him on their all-time [SG rankings](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/nbarankSGs/ranking-top-10-shooting-guards-ever), and not on their all-time [PG rankings](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/nbarankPGs/ranking-top-10-point-guards-ever)*  You thought being a score first player has anything to do with whether you are a point guard or not. Wrong.  You thought if a player averages more assists than a point guard then he must also be a point guard. Wrong.  You keep zero-ing on whether West was an SG or PG, which is irrelevant to this discussion as Curry had both a better peak and better resume. And I've already said that it's subjective but that way more people have him as an SG for a reason.  On this sub, and on /r/ nbadiscussion ([example here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cj5gtp/who_are_your_top_5_shooting_guards_of_alltime/)), way more people consider him to be an SG than a PG. ESPN didn't have him on the PG list, neither did Bleacher Report. But again, it's irrelevant in regards to whether Stockton is better than Curry, or in regards to whether Curry had a higher peak and better resume.  > You also said Curry was better than West regardless of position, which is actually insane.  No, it's really not. I said he had a better peak and resume, and since I value those highly I would have him over West. And clearly many people agree.   *Turns out Bleacher Report's [rankings from 2019](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2852716-nba-all-time-player-rankings-top-10-point-guards#slide9) also don't consider West a PG. They also have Curry above Stockton, and at #2 overall.*  *In fact, the majority of rankings I've found online that were made recently (after Curry's MVPs and championships and numerous elite seasons) have Curry above Stockton. Quite a few have him in the #2 spot as well.*  *This writer for [nba.com](https://www.nba.com/magic/news/ranking-point-guards-history-3-20180126) does have West as a PG, which is a point for you, but they also have Curry in the #2 spot (easily above Stockton).*  *I checked out what the folks over at /r/ nbadiscussion think, and the [majority over there](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ax2s4w/steph_currys_all_time_point_guard_ranking/) seem to have Curry as the #2 PG of all-time as well.*  And let's not forget how you just straight up lied to inflate Stockton's impact:  *This is wrong. First of all, Magic literally had a better assist per game rate over his career. And even if you were talking about best assist per game rate over a single season, then that's still a ""dishonest stat"" as there are multiple players who would have had better assist per game rates than Stockton if they were on those Jazz teams. Stockton is practically the only PG to play his entire starting career alongside one of the best ten scorers in NBA history.*  *And if your comment was referring to best per game rates in a single season, then when it comes to defensive stats you would be even more wrong. There have been multiple players who have exceeded Stockton's career high in defensive stats in a single season (and multiple players who have better per game defensive stats for their career).*  *So whether you meant that no player has matched Stockton's per game assist and defensive stat rates in his peak seasons or over his career, that's a straight up lie. For both steals and assists there are players who have exceeded Stockton's career per game rates, and quite a few players who have exceeded his season-high defensive stat rates. There is so much wrong in your comment I have to wonder if you're on drugs today.*  #Just a pathetic lack of reading comprehension and basketball knowledge lmao."	0

Nope.	1
> That's still what happened. It's basketball. That can happen again  Except that's incredibly unlikely to happen again and if the series were replayed, that wouldn't happen in the vast majority of replays. The Raptors and Bucks were the better teams last season by almost every major metric (offense, defense, best player, etc.). The Sixers weren't even the second best team in their own conference.    > By very basic reasoning, the truth of how things played out suggests that we were the second best team in the playoffs  By this logic, the 49-33 Mavericks were the second best team of the 2014 playoffs because they pushed the eventual champions to 7 in the first round. We both know that's absurd.	1

**How do I work?** First I read as many new comments as I can and turn each one into a list of noun phrases (things like 'raindrop' or 'brown paper package'). Next I pluralize them and run them through an algorithm to determine the number of syllables each noun phrase contains. If I find that your comment contains three noun phrases of 2 syllables each, one noun phrase of 5 syllables, and one noun phrase of 6 syllables I simply insert them into the lyrics and post them back to you! Finding noun phrases, determining syllables counts, and pluralizing words are all very tricky and I often make mistakes!

First option doesn’t really matter considering how even those Bulls shot the ball.  The Celtics were missing 50% of their salary cap and the Raptors had Derozan as their first option.

I would pick Curry if there is another more than average player. Because Curry can't contest the targeted defense since I think 2018. Also I would pick Curry if there are enough great defenders.  I would pick CP3 to lead the younger team, less disciplined team. I would pick CP3 because I don't have an offense system and I don't have an alphamale status as a coach.  Both are great but situational choices.	0

Old guy reporting in--  During most of his career, Malone's off-court life was reported far less than it would be in this age of social media. And in the 80s and 90s he was given much more cover than he would get today. Those of us who cared about statutory rape were in the minority.  That said, although he was a phenomenal NBA star, his on-court behavior was reprehensible enough to make him one of the most hated players in the game without bringing in his scandalous personal life. Just ask David Robinson or Isiah Thomas about Malone's flying elbows. The Postman was perhaps the most dangerous and cold-blooded player in the history of the league. Right up there with Laimbeer.	0
Damn. This is no joke.  Idc I truly believe gobert needs to be hit with charges for the way he acted.   All I learned from the NBA is that it's fine to act like an uneducated retard and you will slide under the charges because of your privilege, even if you are risking killing people  Dumb people need to be shamed publicly and since he has a decent salary, he should be hit hard financially to get a message sent. Somebody like him won't register wrongdoing unless he gets thrown in jail for a few months, cut from the team. And then his money fucked with.  Fuck this guy he also infected his teammate donovan mitchell who is way more valuable, and all around more intelligent than Rudy gobert.  First bending over for China over protest criticism...

I understand the language may be normal in legal proceedings, but the incident itself is rife with racist undertones.

he was getting fucked by the refs and went passive aggressive but it's also proof that those heat teams weren't shit without him. wade was still elite, bosh was never elite and was a solid #3 in most facets of the game but nobody else was gonna carry that team  his FT rate dropped more from the rest of the playoffs to the finals than anyone else you'll find on basketball-reference.com. he took the most shots in the restricted area in the whole series too. dirk got more FTA on jumpers than lebron did on drives  i firmly believe that lebron paid the price for wade's first title where he got 100 FTA and they fucked the mavs  the narrative was that the heat were the bad guys all season and if you think billion dollar leagues don't think about narratives, then who am i to tell you the tooth fairy isn't real either	0

I think the highest rate is 0.2% for people under the age of 55 and that's only deaths/(confirmed cases) which means that it's way less than that because if you do deaths/(unconfirmed + confirmed + asymptomatic) then the rate can only go down. Consider that Vo, Italy is the only city to test all of their population of 1350 after the first person showed symptoms and they discovered that 103 people already had it but showed 0 signs and felt fine. That means more than 99% of the population may have an opportunity to get it and he completely unaffected.  Initial reports estimated 33% of people are unaffected. A week later they estimated 70-90% of people are unaffected. The only numbers that aren't estimates shows greater than 99% may not be effected by the virus.  We still need to look out for the 1% though.  I'm just stating that the numbers are thankfully in most people's favor.	0
The point is that this wouldn't happen in today's NBA without criticism. But because it's Kobe, everyone ignores the obvious flaw in decision making. He could have passed to Slava and got a handoff-screen for a much easier look.  It's quite clear that his teammates' general lack of activity on the play shows that they knew Kobe had no intention of passing, even if he was forced to take a ridiculous low-percentage shot. And their muted reaction immediately afterward speaks volumes of their opinion of him in this moment.	0

If they PM you, don't respond. At best it's overpriced merchandise you can find cheaper elsewhere; worst it's a scam site trying to steal your info or full of malware.  They have likely deleted evidence of their spamming so you can't see it in their profile. Typically they have multiple alt accounts manipulating the vote and ""thanking"" each other or asking where to get it.

The entire 2016 finals, yes game 7 is fantastic, but starting at the beginning gets you really invested. If you want to get REALLY emotionally involved with Lebron’s championship run then start with 2015 when they lose. Watching him lose in 2015 makes watching them win in 2016 so much better.	0

KD wouldn’t have missed this entire season, Klay would have been healthy, Lowry would actually be recognized as a clutch player, Kawhi would still leave for the Clippers, KD would still leave for the Nets and the Nets would be a top team in the East, the Warriors would probably be a playoff team as well but not the same villains that they were.

Dolan is a shitty owner and by all accounts, he’s a shitty man as well. Sucks he hasn’t shown symptoms but there is still time for it to take a turn for the worst! Best we can do at this point is hope & pray he doesn’t recover and New York basketball can rise again after his fortunate demise.	0

> Lol if you think there were legitimately no club house issues on the Celtics last year and that anything positive to say about Kyrie isn't anything but diplomacy  Jaylen Brown has straight up come out and said Kyrie gets way too much blame for their problems last season. I’m pretty sure I trust the players who are actually in the locker room more than you.  > Kyrie is so fucking overrated by you idiots it's crazy.   Imagine hurling insults because somebody disagrees with you about a basketball player. How old are you?  Get upset all you want, but you’re the one letting your personal feelings affect your opinion on him as a basketball player. When the players agree with me that Kyrie wasn’t the problem, and the front offices agree with me that they’d rather have Kyrie than DLo, I think it’s fair to say your opinion isn’t a very logical one.  >He joined a team that almost made the finals and they were worse the very next year. But now it's Tatum and Brown's fault.  They almost made the finals because they went up against a far inferior Cavs team. That Celtics team that made the ECF would have gotten destroyed by the Bucks all the same.  It isn’t Tatum and Brown’s “fault”. I’m just pointing out that they’re simply much better players this season compared to last. In addition, Hayward is having his best season since his all star year in Utah. You’re isolating the “Kyrie bad” narrative when in reality basketball is a team game that is affected by more than just one player. If you replace Kyrie with a PG who’s nearly as good, and every other player takes a step forward then no shit they’re going to be a better team.	0

There are two things that have made me angry in all of this:  1) Donald Trump was briefed on the coronavirus as early as January, and rather than take action, chose to cut the CDC's funding instead.  2) Mitch McConnell decided to take a trip back to Kentucky to see a clerk sworn in rather than work on passing the Families First Act. The man disagreed with the act to begin with, and rather than stay in DC to negotiate tirelessly on our nation's behalf, went back to his home state for a personal event.	1

Ostensibly, it's a matter of supply and demand. Wine is extremely influenced by terroir (microclimate and soil conditions of the growing area), and thus you can have tiny spits of lands that create amazing wine. Domainee de la Romanee-Conti is only about 5 acres in size, and its output is so regarded that bottles have a price floor of around $10K. This is compounded by the variability in weather leading to great years (vintages) and bad years. A 2009 Bordeaux will go for hundreds more than a 2008, because '08 had shitty weather.   In reality, it's driven by marketing and hype. Oenological science (winemaking) has advanced to the point where it's hard to get a truly bad vintage. Even an '08 CdR from a good producer is really really good. I've had a 1990 Chave Hermitage and it did not justify the $400 increase in price point over a 2005.   So then it gets driven up by perceived rarity (splitting up estates into smaller and smaller micro-vineyards), hype (marketing, placement at major restaurants), and **points**. For some UNHOLY REASON, the wine world has decided that ratings are directly equivalent to a universal, non-negotiable value of a wine.   There's a 100pt scale, but anything good starts at 86 or so. Great wine starts at 91. Each point from Wine Advocate or Wine Spectator can justify adding another $80-100 to your MSRP. Robert Parker's word is gospel to the lawyers and dentists of the world who have more money than sense.   In reality, Bron is falling into the trap of buying the points and not the wine. Points are given by individual reviewers, who have their own flavor profiles that appeal to them. They are far from the gospel that they are regarded as, but instead are indicators of a single person's enjoyment of a wine. If you like light, nuanced wine, throw Robert Parker out the window, because the man loves flavor bombs. If you like the mineraly, astringent whites of Alsace and Austria, toss Spectator out, because they only like sweet, creamy whites from California.   Sorry for the rant, quarantine has me pounding coffee and writing like a madman.	0
Lol how can you come even close to pinpointing a recovery rate when a majority of the cases are going undiagnosed including mine? Those are a bunch of hypotheticals. We could fluke up and find a cure next week even thought that’s extremely unlikely. And I would hope the retirement homes and vectors would make a attempt to quarantine the employees and give them guides to follow. It seems to be like most people recover within a week so just give the employees frequent tests and if they test positive don’t let them return until they beat it. Probably who we should be testing rn instead of NBA players and other celebrities who feel fine. And I might be overestimating it but I still feel as if us as human beings went out of are way to check on them and assist them they’d make it through just fine and we could survive without a possible economic crash.	0

"> Your ""actual data"" is compiled by non public health / medical experts   The dataset they analyze actually comes from a joint effort between China and the WHO, which you can find here:  https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf  Are you saying the Doctors who shared this data with the WHO are not medical experts?  > they make a fundamental error which is that the dataset they use skews towards people who needed medical treatment (""laboratory confirmed cases"")  Laboratory confirmed means the infection was confirmed by a laboratory (experts) not that medical treatment was required.  China was aggressively testing people based on contact with others, not just when they felt ill. Asymptomatic cases are in fact part of the dataset and since China was at the forefront of the outbreak, this is the most comprehensive and long term (timeline) data set released to date.  Meanwhile the data you shared doesn’t really have long term symptomatic outcomes  because:  > Soon after identification of the first infections, both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases were transported to designated medical facilities specialised in infectious diseases in Japan.

"[https://np.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/ezytd9/reasons\_that\_john\_paxson\_gar\_forman\_need\_to\_go/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/ezytd9/reasons_that_john_paxson_gar_forman_need_to_go/)  So without further ado, here are my reasons Garpax need to go:  In no particular order  * Cristiano Felicio Contract. He was 25 years old averaging 4 and 4. * Waiving Spencer Dinwiddie in favor of Michael Carter-Williams * Trading Tony Snell for Michael Carter-Williams * Letting Spencer Dinwiddie walk in favor of MCW * John Paxson choking Vinny Del Negro (His own hire), he would later be quoted ""What also disappointed me was that VDN never owned up to making a mistake"" * Fired Scott Skiles on Christmas Eve * Fired Bill Cartwright days after Thanksgiving after giving him mismatched rosters and under-preforming * Overruling This lobbying for Draymond Green to draft Marquis Teague * Refused or failed to take back salary and gather assets preferring to bet on player Development in Jabari Parker & Otto Porter JR * Tyrus Tomas for LaMarcus Aldridge * The biggest free agent signing of their tenure they almost immediately started drama with telling him he was no longer allowed to wear a headband. This policy would appear to be reverted years later w/ no explanation * Interviewed no one for the job of Head Coach but Jim Boylen & hired him. Worse several reporters (For example Vinny Goodwill) have alleged that this was like to have been planned since the summer beforehand. * Blindsided Hoiberg by firing him after showing up expecting to run practice. During his tenure here they fed him a steady stream of their personal projects & mandated them to receive playing time. None of these projects worked out. Examples are Jerian Grant, Cameron Payne, Joffrey Lavergne, Zipser, Felicio, etc. * Leaked that Derrick Rose was healthy to the media putting a ton of pressure on him to return in time for the playoffs & launching a wave of jokes that never really let up * Let Ron Adams go from Thibs Staff angering him & resulting in him going on to be the architect of the Warriors championship defense. He now has 3 rings. * Not trading Pau Gasol in 2015-16 where we would miss the playoffs and he would walk for nothing * Ran such a sloppy situation around Thibs firing that word reached Thibodeau Hoiberg would be his likely replacement while he was still coaching the team. Also serious speculation that this was told to players, undermining his authority as coach. * Thibs even being hired is a win for them right? No, they actually didn't want him. Tom Thibodeau was the recommendation of an outside group hired by Reinsdorf. John Paxson wanted Doug Collins and Gar Forman wanted Mike Brown. * Refused to hire Thibs strength & conditioning coach (Anthony Falsone) in Houston. He would later be hired and win the championship with the San Antonio Spurs in 2013-14. He still serves as their athletic director today. * Escorted Thibs out with security when he was fired. * Overpaid Fred Hoiberg 5 years /25 million and then fired him before it was complete. K.C. Johnson has speculated this is the reason why Jim Boylen remains. As, they don’t want to be paying two coaches not coaching at the same time. * Letting a lot of talent walk for nothing. To avoid the headache of having to defend each and every player in this group I’ll make my case for the best and attach the rest as honorable mentions. Omer Asik is the biggest mistake. We had no backup 5 to replace him and Houston ended up getting an almost lottery pick for him later on so he was definitely moveable if we ever wanted out. Honorable mentions: Deng, Marco, E’Twaun, the Bench mob. * Amnestied Carlos Boozer way too late to be able to matter * Leaked that Kris Dunn apparently wasn’t working hard enough over the summer * Failed to see the writing on the wall and instead of rebuilding committed us to that meaningless three alphas year just to do the same thing in the end. * The entire Doug McDermott situation can be made into like eight bullets and is stupidly controversial among Bulls fans. But I know there will be stans in the comments so I will let them defend Garpax. * Trading 17 & 18 for 11 in the 2013 draft  \*Using #11 to draft Doug Mcderrmott in a good draft.  * Dumping Doug Mcderrmott just two years later for basically nothing. * Were incredibly late to the game of analytics, frequently downplaying its importance. * Kevin O’ Connor speculates that their promising to draft Chandler Hutchison restricted us from doing any draft night trades involving the #22 pick in 2018. Started our rebuild by selling a second- round pick. (We know Jordan Bell isn’t good, that’s never what this was about) * Third largest market in the NBA, paid the luxury tax twice. Traded for OPJ whose making 27 million and has played in 24/78 games available. If his girlfriend is reliable he’s also not a fan of the front office and a free agent in a year. * Horrible medical team. We’re always injured every single year. * Rosters frequently have big holes and they take bizarre steps to fix them. No Small Forward? Jabari. Need a long-term scoring option next to Rose? 33-year-old Rip Hamilton seems like a safe bet. (I love Rip but that doesn’t make it a good signing) Need a solid starting ball-handler & playmaker? Tomas Satorasnky, MCW, Jerian, Rondo seems like the wait maybe nvm. I know that you can’t nail every signing and not even all of these are bad. It’s more that there seems to be consistent gaps between how they evaluate talent & fit and that actually translates to the court. * 5 Playoff Series wins total in a 17-year tenure. * Had a Bulls doctor question Luol Deng about sitting out of games for a broken leg. * Dumped John Salmons and a first & second round pick to chase Lebron and ended up with nothing. * Trading Kirk Hinrich during his farewell tour for basically nothing. * Again, overruling Thibs when he liked Rudy Gobert for Tony Snell * Pulled the QO on David Nwaba for Jabari Parker. I feel like Nwaba while maybe not fantastic on his own fit really well with us. We’ve been a worse team since he left. * Misused Lauri basically his entire time here. Maybe not directly because of this but it’s now being rumored that he wants out. * Traded Taj Gibson in a year we made the playoffs for Cameron Payne & Joffrey Lavergne. * Failing to net any assets at the 2020 trade deadline. * IMO have had serious questions regarding their drafting ability since now Orlando Magic assistant GM left in 2012. * Are alleged to use the media to trash players and coaches by [Van Gundy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I4Y4VyDqrs)  ETA: - Dwade contract  * Couldn't build around Jimmy * Bad player development, everyone is regressing save Zach * Had coaches spy on coaches/players (Randy Brown) * Failed to make Chicago a FA destination * Inherited the prestige Jordan gave us, made us a joke. * Threatening to give Jimmy Butlers minutes to Tony Snell when he refused a contract extension."	0
I was never talking about unbeatable. Michael Jordan needed Scottie to get out of the 2nd round. That is what I said. I never said Scottie was his best when they first made it out of the 2nd round. I also said nurk would give Lillard a chance to make it out of the 2nd round, implying they could compete potentially in the wcf with him. That was all I said. Then you brought up cj in comparison to Scottie when they don’t provide the same sort of core value to the offense and defense that nurk/Scottie do/did in comparison. I think you are slightly undervaluing young Scottie because they ended up losing, when I am only talking about competing, not completely dominating.	1

"I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.  Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called ""Linux"", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.  There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called ""Linux"" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux."	0

Nah.   If you watched the games you would see a couple of things:  1. As u/LuckysBestMan said, Brown was playing fine after recovering from his injuries. To the point where he was probably one of our most consistently good players towards the end of the season.   2. Hayward and Brown ended up working really closely for most of the season. Because they were both in charge of running the bench, you would see those two separating from the group and forming their own huddles during the game to strategise.   They went from being one of the worst duos in the league (when they were both working through injuries), to being a NET positive.  What really hurt us was the finger-pointing and that was predominantly started (at least publicly) by Kyrie and Morris.    We had team-wide problems with effort, attention to detail and communication. Kyrie and Morris made it seem like it was a youth issue and because we had a culture of finger-pointing we never developed a culture of personal responsibility.   You have to understand, Kyrie and Morris were the ones publicly speaking out the most, they ended up setting the narrative.   Fans/Media ate that shit up because there's not a whole lot of critical game analysis going on in the NBA media, most of it is highlights and regurgitated quotes.  There was a lot of unanswered hate towards Brown and Rozier early on.   And then we had two big turning points in terms of perception:  1. We actually had a former Washington Wizards' scout come into our sub with a [breakdown of a game](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/apqz7y/former_nba_scout_and_video_coordinator_bryan/). What he showed was that while Brown and Rozier were gambling too much and making junior mistakes. The really big issue was the senior players taking shortcuts and making the other guys look bad and also blaming other guys (and he tears into Morris).  * Guys weren't properly rotating defensively which would leave other defenders exposed.   * Guys weren't properly running the full length of the court in defensive transition.  * etc etc.       This is a pretty good example from our Milwaukee series of [Kyrie doing it to Morris](https://twitter.com/ZachLowe_NBA/status/1125832190967918593). Now, if that play was Kyrie and Brown and ended with Middleton getting a wide-open 3 or easy backdoor cut, what you would have seen is Kyrie calling out Brown. Even though it was Kyrie fucking up.    2. The Milwaukee series really cleared a lot of the smoke around Kyrie's on-court effort. Because he wasn't performing well offensively, people started noticing his defensive shortcomings.  On the topic of Kyrie calling out his teammates, [I did a breakdown of his Charlotte game](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/epen6c/kyrie_irving_after_tonights_loss_to_the_76ers_i/fejubuw/), but there were other examples throughout the season.	0

"You think there's absolutely no reason for former teammates to dissipate contraversy with diplomatic responses? When did you start watching sports?   I never said dlo was better, I said they were comparable. As in they're both inferior guards who will never contend for championships as the main piece. At the end of the day I'm sure the Celtics would have rather had dlo than Kyrie Irving, the Celtics would rather have an inferior kemba walker than Kyrie too.  Where are your ""facts""? You provided anecdotes and opinions and absolutely no facts.  And no, me calling you an idiot is not me being personally invested. I'm just calling you an idiot. Get over it.  Again, if you don't think Kyrie caused locker room issues with the Celtics last year (issues in Brooklyn and Cleveland too), I dunno what to tell you. You are socially under developed."	0

"He knew his time in Cleveland was over. They tried to trade him and he knew lebron was most likely on board with those moves that didn't pan out. He also wanted to get his own team and lead them or die trying. He wanted to be his own man and credited superstar without all the drama and mayhem of being on a lebron team. He also knew lebron was going to leave and it was smart to not get saddled with a team that was built for lebron that he would fail with. It would create much more talk about how ""he needs lebron, he's nothing but trash without lebron."" It was a good move on his part to get out of there when he did. He had many valid reasons to do so."	0

Westbrick is the most toxic team cancer on the court in NBA history, Ruined Melo's career, he was literally an all star the season before he became a thunder all of a sudden cancerbrick and his stans blamed him for all of OKC's failures.   Once oladipo got away from him he immediately became an all star and led his team to the same record as trash's team despite trash having a vastly superior team.  PG demanded a trade when he finally realized how badly he fucked up staying with the overrated trash.  KD left the thunder because of trashbrick and him liking (and later unliking) several tweets and posts on twitter/instagram bashing trash several different times is no coincidence, even his brother was bashing him as well.   There isnt a player that makes star teammates worse than trash and its not even close. How the fuck do you get outplayed by a rookie and lose to a rookie led team that didnt have a single all star in their entire roster in the first round especially when you have 2 HoFers on your team.  If that isnt enough proof to convince you hes a toxic team killing cancer, look at the thunder, immediately got much better the second they traded him, even has a record much better than trash's new team.   Trash is Lucky the season got suspended, harden was looking to be trash's next victim, and oh boy if they lost to okc in the 1st round, i mean trash's career is already buried with a tombstone, but that would be a cherry on top of his career's coffin.	0

> because no number I’ll ever say will change your mind  Because you've already clearly laid out you have no idea what a vertical is or how it's measured.    > that's not how we determine vertical because you're not standing perfectly upright like you are when we measure standing reach. You lean your body back when you're jumping from a running start, that's where the other 2 inches go  Yeah that's all complete bullshit.  NFL, NBA, college basketball, it's all measured the same way.   Someone stands on the ground, touches the highest point they can.  Then they jump and touch the highest point they can.  The difference is your vert.  It's as simple as it gets, the only differences is now they use a vertec, which just sets the measurement at the right height for the player but it's the same principle.   > it's almost like there's a reason we don't use standing reach to determine vertical. I'm not sure if you know this, but when you jump from a running start, your body isn't 100% upright.  Just blatantly wrong.  How are you arguing this?  [You realize there's a ton of video from NBA and NFL combines, right?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMz1CKMOLr4)  > can literally see his feet that far off the ground in the video  No one can be this dumb^.  You don't measure a vertical from the ground because legs aren't straight in the air.  I didn't jump higher just because I bent my knees more.  > Unless you have another source I’m gonna go ahead and trust the multiple measurements that have been done.   What multiple measurements?  We have his standing reach, the only other number we need is max reach.  In the video they said that was 12' 4.5 inches.  Please link me anywhere else his vertical was measured.	1

"This is exactly what I'm talking about.   People think the accusations were disproved or that there was some sort of disagreement over the evidence.  Why exactly is unclear.  The only time Kobe challenged any of the factual accusations was when he thought he could make it go away by lying to the police when he was first arrested.   Rose confirmed every single piece of evidence brought up to him in the case.   All the Rose case proves is that its basically impossible to get a date rapist convicted in a criminal court because you can't prove mens rea even when you get the rapist to admit to it.  All they have to say is ""I thought she consented,"" regardless of whether there is a textbook's worth of evidence that she did not."	0

I think the 2008-2009 Cleveland Cavaliers are forgotten about as one of these teams. I feel once KG went down in ‘09 playoffs, the path was cleared for LeBron and the Cavaliers.

We could have had LeBron vs Kobe that year.	0
Don't underestimate the power of a little help on the hip or shoulder, and definitely don't underestimate the official's decision and why he called it. These guys are good, and that hip shove is exactly why the foul was called. It destroys your balance, and jump shooting is mostly about about balance and rhythm.
