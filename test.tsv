China certainly has their issues but they're not the reason the US has the highest death toll from COVID-19 in the world right now.  I agree with Lin, we should stop with the finger pointing. We need to take action and demand that those in office take action. We need to be proactive because simply looking for someone to blame is just a distraction, and let's be honest, a lot of it is rooted in racism. I've seen some pretty disgusting things said about China and their people and this idea that they need to be punished seems to only stoke racial tensions.	0

That's not the same thing at all dummy. I copied my previous comment back because you hadn't responded to it, but then I immediately removed it because I knew you wouldn't respond to it since you always run away from arguments. (Just like how you still haven't responded to those claims).  > So you cried about me editing comments  No, I pointed out your edit when you tried to lie about not reposting.   I have been upfront about my reposts and about editing this last comment (**which wasn't even an edit technically since I immediately changed it, which is why reddit doesn't have it marked as an edit**)  You really need to learn how to structure better arguments. You just jump from one argument to another because they are so poorly thought out and they immediately get torn apart.	0

I mean I get what PG is talking about. It's a different culture in LA because he was revered as a diety here. He really was the face of our city in a way not even Jeter or Magic or any sports legend from here can compare to. But that doesnt mean other people didn't share that love. PG is just saying that for us Kobe Bryant was part of our daily lives, from conversation to conversation, even after he retired. The lot of us were crying over his retirement lamenting that basketball would never be the same. But again, Kobe was an influence for many people and deeply loved all over, so I can understand why people would be thinking he's gatekeeping grief. I get where he's coming from though.	1

You mean like repealing the Obama admins retarded FDA regulations?

Or are you really that naive to believe the literal propaganda that they, and the american media, is trying to feed you.  >Eventually the states got their own programs going and picked up the slack.

The Rockets defense is good when they try which is a good sign for the playoffs.   It's funny how different defenses rank when you filter out bad teams from the equation and look at defenses vs top ~15 offenses. Some at the top shoot down, others lower ranked shoot up. Rockets are good they just dont always beat bad teams when they're supposed to.   Bucks, for example, go from the #1 overall defense to the #8 defense against the top 15 offenses,  Utah goes from #8 to #17. Rockets go from #15 to #10, which isn't amazing but for what their offense is rated that's really good to improve that much on D vs top offenses   Harden's D is actually insane now too, which is almost certainly because Russ takes a lot of his offensive energy expenditure	1

Reposting from another thread to spread awareness:  Damn.  Not to take away from Jaemal’s embarrassment because I know firsthand how it feels but this really throws back to the time my fucking sister posted our video on her finsta.  I didn’t even wanna go to school the next day cuz everyone already knew (we were 2 grades apart, she was a junior and i was a freshmen)  Prayers go out to Jaemal for this. Shit is embarrassing af and it’s honestly the worst feeling. I’m probably gonna reach out to him to let him know he’s not alone  All in all, let’s respect this man’s mistake and move on from this. It’s extremely embarrassing for your videos to go on public by accident and I really wouldn’t wish it on anyone— celebrity or not and hung or not. Jarmal Murray is a great basketball player and I hope he can be remembered as that rather than someone who’s sex tapes were leaked. It’s actually incredibly embarrassing for the girl as she is facing embarrassment because of the fuckup of another person, in my scenario i can relate to his girl because my sister somehow posted our video because she’s a dumb bitch.	0

I’m glad that people aren’t just letting this happen. When small businesses have to make staff cutbacks and whatnot so they don’t go out of business that’s one thing. When billionaire franchise owners make cutbacks so they don’t have to endure a relatively tiny amount of money being taken from their unfathomably massive bank accounts, they can go fuck themselves.   The super wealthy in the modern day, especially in America, really have their cake and eat it too when it comes to the fact that they want to hoard all the money *and* not be hated by the regular people. So let’s keep on publicly shaming them when they pull shit like this, when it works it works.	0

aren't there cases of people who have gone through transgender surgery and find out later that they weren't actually transgender in the first place? I remember watching this video a few weeks ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLewBHur61Q  At the same time I know people like Kim Petras that did surgery at a young age, 16 before puberty hit her and is living her best life right now. Personally I feel identifying as transgender is fine for a kid, but I'm not so sure on decisions in regards to surgery because there's no turning back.	1

"...and then they revolted again and again until finally establishing a system that stuck. That's the point. Nobody's saying that the people who took over after the Bourbons were paragons of virtue.  The French revolutions lessened religious interference in politics, reshaped land ownership and did away with tithes and religious taxation that kept the farmers eternally poor, inspired the destruction of multiple oligarchies which led to economic boom across Europe and laid the groundwork for multiple modern ideologies. It was worth the struggle.  We're literally living in a timeline where the American government is openly debating how many workers are worth killing to make sure the rich don't get slightly less rich. Your response to perhaps the most successful political revolution of all time has to be more than ""but it sounds hard""."	0
fair enough, that makes sense. I’m just never sure how to define what “transitioning” truly means when it can mean a number of different things to people. That definitely makes sense though   Going back to my original comment, I wasn’t trying to speak on what is/isn’t appropriate/complicated/acceptable for trans people. Just that, I feel like the majority of people have a much more difficult time being able to accept trans people as opposed to being accepting of gay/bi people. Probably because it’s a more complicated issue in the eye of the public   Hope I worded that well enough	1

"> So the federal minimum wage .... how dense can you be? Your own link is tell you that you are wrong.  Oh god he's retarded...  In USA: Federal minimum wage means enforced minimum wage for everything except small exceptions (AKA the vast, vast majority of things)  In Canada: Federal minimum wage means everything that the provinces don't have control of (aka minority of services)  So Sanders minimum wage proposal > *significantly* more to the left of current Canadian minimum wage system.  >You: ""Sanders would be to the left or center of Canadian politics""  I never said he would be in the center. Are YOU having the stroke? Or do you just need to make things up so you can win the internet argument? Sanders would be far left in Canada.

Its funny I said something similar about him maximizing his full potential with a great culture, surrounding cast, and winning . Hearing that he's having more fun and now Draymond coming out saying they're trying to help him is a good sign that he's in a great situation for him to live up to his full potential. Maybe about a week back I talked about this on my [podcast](https://www.buzzsprout.com/794936/2699953)  and I think Wiggins will be a great fit with the Warriors once Steph and Klay come back. He's not going to get doubled teamed with those great shooters on the floor with him and he's a proven scorer like Draymond said. I like the move alot for the Warriors	1

Unfortunately, no matter how hard a person might *consciously* try to treat every person the same way and avoid prejudice based on appearance, it's impossible to avoid feeling what's been embedded into one's subconscious mind. News, advertisements, films, tv, etc all have a hand in scultping the way we frame the world, and it's difficult to undo all that, all the time. Acknowledging the existence of these *implicit biases* is a great first  step towards undoing them.	1

Imagine how good someone who becomes a star in the NBA was when they were a kid. When what they were doing not only worked, they crushed everyone and people were (correctly) telling them they're going to be a star in the NBA one day.  Now try to 'help' that kid out by telling him to change something that he doesn't want to change. He's going to laugh at you and tell you to go fuck yourself.  That's not the correct response and some kids wont do that, that's how you get LeBron and Steph and Tim Duncan who are so great at fundamentals. They were coachable. But not everyone is like them.	0

Mullin never went deep into the playoffs.  Ewing, Malone, Drexler, Barkley, these were the guys MJ stepped on to win rings.  And whom Magic and Bird stepped on before.  The difference IMO between Barkley and the rest of em, is Barkley felt if he had help like Pippen and PJ, he’d have won the same as MJ.  The Dream Team gave him the chance to demonstrate it.  Drexel matched up head to head with MJ so had no disillusions.	0

The governments of the world (specifically China) have an interest in how much they can control the population. Then whenever they want similar ramifications as this years virus, they can either A.

If you notice, Ibaka's feet are also moving; almost trembling. To the viewer, Sexton looks unsure as to whether or not Ibaka will drive, shoot, or pass since his feet dont show his intentions. So, he remains in perpetual motion so he can close out, switch, or prevent the drive. Little did he know that the shaking was just Ibaka trying wiggle his giant cock as everything he wears down there is too tight. This, in turn, create mini-earth quakes which are rocking Ibaka and possibly Sexton	1

The point is that this wouldn't happen in today's NBA without criticism. But because it's Kobe, everyone ignores the obvious flaw in decision making. He could have passed to Slava and got a handoff-screen for a much easier look.  It's quite clear that his teammates' general lack of activity on the play shows that they knew Kobe had no intention of passing, even if he was forced to take a ridiculous low-percentage shot. And their muted reaction immediately afterward speaks volumes of their opinion of him in this moment.	0

You can make the argument that his 2011 playoff performance completely shed his reputation as a playoff choker. His career prior to that had seen his team:  - blow a 2-0 lead in the 2006 Finals - lose as the 1-seed in the first round in 2007 (first time that had happened in a best-of-7 series) - lose as the 2-seed in the first round in 2010 (first time that had happened in a best-of-7 series)  If you go back and watch his highlights from that postseason (particularly against the Thunder and Heat), I believe it undid all the damage done from those earlier years.	0

"Oh hell yeah brother, I totally hear you! Really like your description, and I would even go as far to say Dirks ring is THE most valuable off all time (at least that I have witnessed).  But i also think the KD narrative is greatly overblown, Steph was still just as impactful in those playoffruns and I just can't fault someone for bringing in the 2nd best player in the league when you have the chance to do so.  And if you go with the Asterisk for his first then you have to start putting one to every single other title (like Lebrons the year after, because of the Green suspension).  In short I firmly believe Stephs 3 rings combined outweigh Dirks, although I will admit, ""greatly"" may just be a tad bit too much."	0

This is actually not true. I assume when you say ethnic, you're not referring to black people, and you are Hispanic/Asian.    > Roughly six in ten white (59%), Hispanic (60%), and mixed-race Americans (59%) and close to seven in ten (69%) Asian-Pacific Islander (API) Americans favor same-sex marriage. Black Americans are more divided with fewer than half (48%) expressing support for allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry, while 41% are opposed. However, this represents a five-point increase in support for same-sex marriage, compared to 43% in 2015.  This is from https://www.prri.org/research/americans-views-discrimination-immigrants-blacks-lgbt-sex-marriage-immigration-reform/.  Theoretically speaking gay marriage support isn't a perfect correlation to homophobia, but it's a decent measure. In this case, Asians and Hispanics support gay marriage more than white people, and black people support it decently less than white people, 59% vs 48%, but that's not like some insane margin that would lead me to say that it's much more unpopular among people of color.	1

No the bigger problem there was Asians across the country came out in masses to justify Peter Liang's murder of an unarmed innocent Black Man, using the excuse that White Officers get away with it so Asian cops should to. That was very dehumanizing, and you never seen Black Americans do that kind of thing as a collective to any group. Asians here in the United States have a long rap sheet of Anti Black American culture and behavior as a collective. Yet Foundational Black Americans been their main supporters since mass immigration became a thing in the 1970s. Again if White People came out in masses to support a White cop murdering a innocent Black Man, we would called them White Supremacist/Neo Nazis, Lynch Mobs, you name it. So why is it OK for Asians to do that? Yet they cry about Racism when White Supremacist turn on them? Again, don't cry to us Foundational Black Americans. Fight your own battle. Stop running to us whenever White Supremacist starts attacking them. Because any other time the Asian community seem to as a collective be perfectly fine with White Supremacy when the victim is Black. Again hold your own pair.	0

This is the most important comment in this chain. Trans issues, especially where minors are concerned, are still treated with a healthy dose of gay panic and fear-mongering by people who actively want to harm these individuals, and oftentimes talking points get picked up in the swirl of condemnation by well meaning people who aren’t as informed on the issue.  Dwayne wade simply said that he supports and acknowledges his daughters existence. He never went into detail about what that meant, but plenary of people outside of the issue like to fill in the blanks for themselves with the most extreme version of what “support” means.  Also, just as an addendum, hormone blockers can actually be extremely beneficial to adolescent trans people, and many of the supposed “permanent” ramifications are in serious dispute because of the wide range of experiences on them.	1

I disagree, it is not a transphobic point to question or wonder otherwise. Where are you getting that 1%? How many people regret without going through the pain of transitioning back? More details can be found here: https://quillette.com/2020/01/02/the-ranks-of-gender-detransitioners-are-growing-we-need-to-understand-why/  I get that a lot of people in the world are trying to discredit homosexuality and trans rights, but if we are going to label anything contrary to unwavering support as transphobic then I feel we are doing a disservice to the trans community. To people like that person in the video and others. Also I feel my point about Kim Petras shows that I don't believe the feeling of being born in the wrong sex is some delusion.	1

It's not shocking because the country has become used to it.  American productivity since 1973 has increased by 77 percent, and if wages had kept pace with productivity, workers would be earning more than $20 an hour. Instead, over 41 million American workers – a third of the workforce – earn less than $12 an hour without employee-sponsored health insurance. And health costs are the number one cause of bankruptcy.    Work or be chewed apart.  You don't even deserve your health, your children don't deserve a good education, you don't deserve a safe place to live, you don't deserve equal treatment under the law... unless of course you are NOT poor. You work not because you love money but because you fear the jaws of poverty like a pack of wraiths and know your neighbors won't care to help you.	0

The record and the championships don't say much. UCLA had won two consecutive championships before Kareem and then went on to win four straight the second he left. They were a ridiculously dominant team regardless of him and won multiple championships and rarely lost games without him.  Kareem is in the conversation, but to act like he is undeniably the GOAT is plain absurd... Go look at what Bird did in his three years at Indiana fucking State and you will understand why. Bill Walton also has a legitimate claim as the college basketball GOAT and so has Oscar Robertson.  So yeah, saying that calling anyone besides Kareem the GOAT is ridiculous actually is absolutely retarded.	0
Finally some good news for the Knicks	0
Based on what. In the first month of the season KD is averaging 27ppg on 68.1 TS% and Curry 26ppg on 65.7 TS%. Curry has a greater playmaking load than Durant and was still the centerpiece of their offball actions that the foundation of their offense is built upon.  It was very much so a 1A, 1B partnership. Lots of debates of who was the best player on the team with no decisive answer.	0

Doubt you will look into this, you'll probably just keep your head in the sand. 2009, 4g roll out. Swine Flu outbreak. 3g rolled out in 2001 - SARS outbreak 2002. Radio towers massively rolled out.

"Was careful to avoid those exact words.  I am just so fed up with this bullshit. Many of those NBA reporters probably want to stay up to date and read r/nba click a link about their work and read the worst crap, written by some embarrassing losers. It's one thing to constructively criticise lacking work or a bad take. But why does Windhorst, who does a lot of great work, get constantly shat on? For what reason in this world do people hate on Shelbourne, MacMullan and Doris Burke?  I get when people constantly hold a person with real influence or power accountable. Trump for his terrible presidency, Lebron for his Hongkong comments or Mark Cuban for the sexual harrasment scandal within the Mavs organisation. But an online crusade against a reporter who asked a disagreeable question on a shaky premise, really?  I am absolutely serious with my following assumption: ""Many of those little fuckers, had they any power in society later, would put on some black uniforms, march the streets, surpress women and straw man minorities to finally gas a few millions people."""	0

Even if you believe the [deliberately and grossly inflated statistics out of Italy](https://swprs.org/a-swiss-doctor-on-covid-19/) which are not even close to representative of reality, even if you believe CoV is a thing, it’s objectively far less deadly that the flu or tuberculosis.

">You have not debunked a single thing in that video. The only thing you proved is that the word soon is technically true if you want to be generous and include that we will have it by next flu season.   I'll keep copying and pasting until you address it.   LMAO okay man. The video is nothing but bullshit. The virus wasn't a big deal in America mid January at that point. No need for revisionist history. Saying that most people will get better is TRUE. Saying that it will likely be over soon is TRUE. Saying there are treatments and vaccines coming soon is TRUE. Like the majority of what he said in there is factually correct. Why can't you understand that? He has taken the measures necessary to get this under control. It's also his job to not fucking spread panic and throw us into anarchy.  Literally a week before Trump said he didn't think it was a pandemic in January the WHO was saying that human to human transmission of the disease was not happening. The entire fucking world wasn't taking it seriously at that point.  >Comparing to regular drugs development is a strawman. His intent was not ""dont worry we will have a vaccine within 12 years""  His intent is that we will have something to fight the virus in the near future. Having a vaccine ready by next flu season is fucking soon man i dont give a fuck what you say. Keep ignoring the fact that therapeutic treatments are available already. Doesn't fit your retarded narrative.  >That was a total of what 5-7 seconds of the video. How about the other 2:05? The video is date stamped, it is not trying to skew what he said, even said there are only 8 cases in America at the time. That does not dismiss the criticism of him saying ""we have shut it down"" while cases were on the rise in January, not does it address the other 95% of the video.  I addressed most of it in my previous comments. Please read slower.  >Your link about test kits having the hiccup (which I cant even read because you linked a website that forces you to create an account) does not dismiss the criticism of him saying ""as of yesterday and today anyone can get a test"" These test production errors occurred in February, it was known at the time we did not have enough tests and he lied about it.  How does it fucking not? Companies preparing and shipping tests tell trump they are ready and how many will be available now and in the future. Trump then says they're available. Then you have the issues come up. Is it that hard to follow dude?  >Now we are on to whataboutisms. I am not a fan of any of the people you have named. I have never voted democrat in my life and am just as critical to them as I am Trump. Wish you were too, but your likely part of the Trump cult who are political hacks who consistently trash the media for being fake news but never Trump who is one of the largest providers of it.  DGAF who you voted for. You would be surprised who I voted for in the past but that's completely irrelevant. Doesn't make your retarded logic any better. It's not whataboutism, it's admitting that the dude isn't perfect but that video is bullshit and is overplaying any apparent mishandling of the virus.   >Please show me where you debunked that Trump did not say cases are going to go down in late February when there were 80K+ cases in the world?  Talking about the vaccines. What he said there was flat out wrong and I already said as such.  >If you reread what I wrote, I specifically said Trump did not say this just that he consistently endorses the people who made those dangerous claims. I said people at Fox went even further than Trump did. I did not say Trump said it was a hoax nor that he praised their specific response to the hoax. The favorite network of the guy who consistently says ""fake news"" were endangering people with their careless reporting on the virus.  Such an absurd way to attempt to attach something to Trump it's not worthy of a response."	0

MLB learned its lesson after the McCourt saga, where it allowed him to buy the Dodgers when he didnt actually have many (if any) liquid funds. Instead, it allowed him to use real estate he owned, including the parking lot next to Dodgers Stadium, as collateral for financing. Of course, eventually he couldn't meet the payroll. Rules were changed so new owners had to have certain liquidity to be able to purchase a team. The NBA should have never allowed someone who theoretically was asset rich, but cash poor, to buy a team, and utilize as much debt on his future personal finances. You can use debt to buy a team, but you need that person can actually provide liquid funding if need be. And that's before you dig further into Fertitta/his family's finances. Then you learn they truly don't have any cash on hand	0
I know this is 6 days ago but I just saw I saved this post and you replied so I need to share this with someone  If you look right at the beginning of the last clip you can see Steph IMMEDIATELY see draymond coming and then looks over his other shoulder and sees the water  Then you see dray walK behind him but then Steph turns head SLIGHTLY and his eyes start flicking that way to see when Green picks up the cup. He saw it all before it even happened and hit the perfect shot  It happens so fast it seems like random luck almost but when you look at it closely it’s clear he knew exactly what he was doing  ****I’m so sorry I’m just high and saw this video again and noticed this. I will probably make a  self.post tomorrow breaking it down but I needed to make sure I didn’t forget haha	0

I don't.   Pippen - Curry simply does not compute. Because I have an understanding of Pippens role for the Bulls, and an understanding for Currys role for the Warriors even with KD. Not remotely the same, as with Curry he was usually the Warriors most impactful player until the NBA Finals. 1A 1B in other settings, and MJ/Pippen were certainly not 1A 1B.	0

Yep. China fucked up badly and ignored the problem for 6 weeks.   Once they realized it they shut down a city with more people than 43 states in this country. And they had testing, they built hospitals, forcibly quarantined everyone. And now they're over the hump.   The only Apple Stores that are gonna be open in the world will soon be in China. That's mind-boggling for the country that was worst hit.   But the American people deserve this and more for electing Trump.	1

How will quarantine increase the duration of this pandemic? If people are inside and not in contact there will be less cases, hence, with time, it'll go away. If we all stayed inside for the next month without leaving our homes once, it would go away because there wouldn't be more infections.  If you know that you playing basketball doesn't help this situation and could be putting people at risk if in touch with them, why are you still doing it? We all know it's hard to stay home for a long period of time but the longer we adjourn this isolation, the longer the virus will be around (contrary to what you've been stating), just make an effort, for the sake of everyone else that is doing that effort, to be careful. You can take all precautions but if you're playing Basketball with someone that is infected (and you can't know for sure who is and isn't) all those precautions are just wasted.	0

You've fallen for MSM lies.  Here’s the real timeline of what happened (all of this BEFORE we had even one death in the US) :   1/6 CDC issues travel advisory for Wuhan.   1/11 CDC tweets about corona related “pneumonia outbreak in China”   1/14 WHO tweets that there is no evidence of human to human transmission.   1/17 CDC started doing health screenings at 3 airports of travelers from China.   1/21 first case in US for someone who traveled directly from Wuhan.   1/23 WHO again says no human to human transmission outside of China.   1/27 WHO raises alert level but is still saying China has it contained.   1/28 CDC states “ While CDC considers covid a serious situation and is taking preparedness measures, the immediate risk in the US is considered low.”   1/29 White House announces Coronavirus Task Force created. Note - this is despite the WHO downplaying the threat!   1/31 Trump bans travel from China. Media and multiple Democrats slam his decision calling it racist/xenophobic. 2/5 Trump acquitted (impeachment).   2/5 Chuck Schumer in a tweet continues to call Trumps’ travel ban from China “premature.”   2/7 White House’s Coronavirus Task Force gives press briefing.   2/9 White House Coronavirus Task Force meets with all governors regarding virus.   2/12 CDC waiting for approval from Chinese for CDC team to travel to China.   2/18 HHS announces partnership to develop vaccine.   2/21 Italy identifies its very first case in their country.   2/21 CDC tweets that it is working with States for preparedness.   2/24 Trump sent letter to Congress asking for $25B for virus effort.   2/24 Nancy Pelosi made a stop in Chinatown and encouraged people to “please come and visit and enjoy Chinatown.”   2/25 there is still no reported community spread in the US!!! (Per CDC tweet.)   2/27 first community transmission in US.   2/27 Trump appoints Pence to coordinate efforts.   2/29 FIRST reported Covid19 death in US.   It is helpful to look at the actual timeline. All of this happened BEFORE the 1st death in US.	0

This isnt true at all. On any level.  Lin wasn't traded. He got injured that year. He was a restricted RFA and the Rockets offered such a huge contract that the Knicks didn't want to match. At the time of his signing, the third year was $15 million. That was more than all but like the top 20 players in the league was making. Lebron and Chris Paul were making $16 million that year. Lin wasn't that good and there were concerns he wasn't going to be the same when he recovered.   As for the Melo vs Lin thing... The media completely manufactured it as far as anyone call tell.

Wrong, I'm almost 40 so I grew up in the Jordan era and I'm very familiar with all the players and teams we're talking about. That 96 Supersonics team isn't beating the Warriors or Spurs teams that Lebron faced in any finals. That team was very good, but it wasn't historically great (they won a total of zero titles) - the Warriors and Spurs teams are. And yes Lebron would excel in any system, especially a Phil Jackson system, he's never played for a coach **remotely close** to the level of Phil.	1

Something like this was posted last night, and again people are calling him evil when they have zero understanding of what is going on.  Since I’m quarantined and have nothing to do I’ll explain this for everyone:  Depending on the state, servers make anywhere from tipped minimum wage to regular minimum wage, same with bussers. Hosts/hostesses/kitchen employees make minimum wage to that plus a few bucks.  On a typical night, Morton’s (A Landry’s restaurant) staffs like this:   12 Servers/Bartenders @ 3.63 per hour. Average of 7 hours worked each= $305  6 Backservers/Barbacks @ 5.50 per hour. Average of 6 hours worked each= $198   3 Hosts @ 12.75 per hour. Avg 5 hours= $191  12 Kitchen Employees @ 15 per hour 7 hours worked each= $1260  So on my low staffing estimate we have just under $2000 per day. This is without adjusting the pay to meet the minimum wage, which would have to happen for tipped employees because obviously they aren’t getting tips right now.   Even without that adjustment, over his 500+ restaurants Fertitta would be spending $1000000 a day just on paying his hourly employees their hourly rate. There are plenty of other operating costs on top of this.  These employees are eligible for unemployment. Sure it’s not what they normally make but it’s enough to get by with the bare minimum. I would know I’m doing it right now.  Any questions? I have a nap scheduled for 3 but besides that my day is pretty wide open	1
He is averaging 29/5/9 on 45/37/85 shooting splits (60% TS) for the whole season. In wins he is averaging 35/5/9 on 53/48/80 shooting split (69.6%!! TS).      He absolutely deserved the starting spot and if you don't think so then I really question how much you've really watched him play.       > They’re bad on offense and defense. The system is designed for him to get points.      This has got to be one of the stupidest statements I have ever seen. He is an elite scorer and an elite playmaker and you're trying to phrase it to say that the Hawks team is only made for him to get counting stats. They aren't a great team so there is only so much he can do but what he is doing has been historic for an individual. I don't know how you can even watch Hawks games and act like he doesn't deserve the starting nod. If he didn't play I doubt the Hawks would even have 5 wins for the year at this stage.	1

A reality that many Americans face. Maybe have some perspective  Now you will imply that 16k is nothing to Kendrick but it will just prove how disconnected someone like that is from the real world and thus how that punishment was literally nothing	0

"okay, so not really any love for brokers from me . . .  . . . but y'all are morons if you think ticketmaster, promoters and  artists ""hate"" scalpers.  They literally create them.  Intentionally.  Because it means they can set simple price points and sell out stadiums AND make more money.  The alternative is much riskier.  Put another way: you COULD (if you do it JUST RIGHT) make just as much  money on ticket sales with a 1/2 full arena and a ""properly"" priced  market.  But then they would all die on merch and concessions, AND have a  pissed off artist and promoter who looks like they can't draw the  venues they book.  But instead, until 2018 ticketmaster OWNED ITS OWN RESELLER MARKETPLACES.  GET IT?  The reseller market is a DEMAND CUSHION created BY AND FOR the ticketing agencies and the promoters and venues they work for.  If they wanted it to go away, they would price differently.  Instead, they  throw that entire margin to the brokers because its not worth the risk  of not selling as many $15 Bud Lights.  These people aren't stupid.  Ticket scalpers are not that far from independent, un-contracted employees.  They perform a service for the ticketing  agencies/teams/venues/artists/promoters.  I'm sorry to be the one  informing you of this.  It's the  billionaire-who's-sports-team-you-worship's fault.  Fucking duh.  tldr: blame ticketmaster you hapless fuckwits.  It's their fault we live these lies.  In fact, I'm pretty sure even Ticketmaster is more of a PR fall-guy than some kind of mastermind.  They literally exist for you to blame."	0

Nah.   If you watched the games you would see a couple of things:  1. As u/LuckysBestMan said, Brown was playing fine after recovering from his injuries. To the point where he was probably one of our most consistently good players towards the end of the season.   2. Hayward and Brown ended up working really closely for most of the season. Because they were both in charge of running the bench, you would see those two separating from the group and forming their own huddles during the game to strategise.   They went from being one of the worst duos in the league (when they were both working through injuries), to being a NET positive.  What really hurt us was the finger-pointing and that was predominantly started (at least publicly) by Kyrie and Morris.    We had team-wide problems with effort, attention to detail and communication. Kyrie and Morris made it seem like it was a youth issue and because we had a culture of finger-pointing we never developed a culture of personal responsibility.   You have to understand, Kyrie and Morris were the ones publicly speaking out the most, they ended up setting the narrative.   Fans/Media ate that shit up because there's not a whole lot of critical game analysis going on in the NBA media, most of it is highlights and regurgitated quotes.  There was a lot of unanswered hate towards Brown and Rozier early on.   And then we had two big turning points in terms of perception:  1. We actually had a former Washington Wizards' scout come into our sub with a [breakdown of a game](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/apqz7y/former_nba_scout_and_video_coordinator_bryan/). What he showed was that while Brown and Rozier were gambling too much and making junior mistakes. The really big issue was the senior players taking shortcuts and making the other guys look bad and also blaming other guys (and he tears into Morris).  * Guys weren't properly rotating defensively which would leave other defenders exposed.   * Guys weren't properly running the full length of the court in defensive transition.  * etc etc.       This is a pretty good example from our Milwaukee series of [Kyrie doing it to Morris](https://twitter.com/ZachLowe_NBA/status/1125832190967918593). Now, if that play was Kyrie and Brown and ended with Middleton getting a wide-open 3 or easy backdoor cut, what you would have seen is Kyrie calling out Brown. Even though it was Kyrie fucking up.    2. The Milwaukee series really cleared a lot of the smoke around Kyrie's on-court effort. Because he wasn't performing well offensively, people started noticing his defensive shortcomings.  On the topic of Kyrie calling out his teammates, [I did a breakdown of his Charlotte game](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/epen6c/kyrie_irving_after_tonights_loss_to_the_76ers_i/fejubuw/), but there were other examples throughout the season.	0

Unfortunately, no matter how hard a person might *consciously* try to treat every person the same way and avoid prejudice based on appearance, it's impossible to avoid feeling what's been embedded into one's subconscious mind. News, advertisements, films, tv, etc all have a hand in scultping the way we frame the world, and it's difficult to undo all that, all the time. Acknowledging the existence of these *implicit biases* is a great first  step towards undoing them.	0
"[https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/ezytd9/reasons\_that\_john\_paxson\_gar\_forman\_need\_to\_go/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/ezytd9/reasons_that_john_paxson_gar_forman_need_to_go/)  So without further ado, here are my reasons Garpax need to go:  In no particular order  * Cristiano Felicio Contract. He was 25 years old averaging 4 and 4. * Waiving Spencer Dinwiddie in favor of Michael Carter-Williams * Trading Tony Snell for Michael Carter-Williams * Letting Spencer Dinwiddie walk in favor of MCW * John Paxson choking Vinny Del Negro (His own hire), he would later be quoted ""What also disappointed me was that VDN never owned up to making a mistake"" * Fired Scott Skiles on Christmas Eve * Fired Bill Cartwright days after Thanksgiving after giving him mismatched rosters and under-preforming * Overruling This lobbying for Draymond Green to draft Marquis Teague * Refused or failed to take back salary and gather assets preferring to bet on player Development in Jabari Parker & Otto Porter JR * Tyrus Tomas for LaMarcus Aldridge * The biggest free agent signing of their tenure they almost immediately started drama with telling him he was no longer allowed to wear a headband. This policy would appear to be reverted years later w/ no explanation * Interviewed no one for the job of Head Coach but Jim Boylen & hired him. Worse several reporters (For example Vinny Goodwill) have alleged that this was like to have been planned since the summer beforehand. * Blindsided Hoiberg by firing him after showing up expecting to run practice. During his tenure here they fed him a steady stream of their personal projects & mandated them to receive playing time. None of these projects worked out. Examples are Jerian Grant, Cameron Payne, Joffrey Lavergne, Zipser, Felicio, etc. * Leaked that Derrick Rose was healthy to the media putting a ton of pressure on him to return in time for the playoffs & launching a wave of jokes that never really let up * Let Ron Adams go from Thibs Staff angering him & resulting in him going on to be the architect of the Warriors championship defense. He now has 3 rings. * Not trading Pau Gasol in 2015-16 where we would miss the playoffs and he would walk for nothing * Ran such a sloppy situation around Thibs firing that word reached Thibodeau Hoiberg would be his likely replacement while he was still coaching the team. Also serious speculation that this was told to players, undermining his authority as coach. * Thibs even being hired is a win for them right? No, they actually didn't want him. Tom Thibodeau was the recommendation of an outside group hired by Reinsdorf. John Paxson wanted Doug Collins and Gar Forman wanted Mike Brown. * Refused to hire Thibs strength & conditioning coach (Anthony Falsone) in Houston. He would later be hired and win the championship with the San Antonio Spurs in 2013-14. He still serves as their athletic director today. * Escorted Thibs out with security when he was fired. * Overpaid Fred Hoiberg 5 years /25 million and then fired him before it was complete. K.C. Johnson has speculated this is the reason why Jim Boylen remains. As, they don’t want to be paying two coaches not coaching at the same time. * Letting a lot of talent walk for nothing. To avoid the headache of having to defend each and every player in this group I’ll make my case for the best and attach the rest as honorable mentions. Omer Asik is the biggest mistake. We had no backup 5 to replace him and Houston ended up getting an almost lottery pick for him later on so he was definitely moveable if we ever wanted out. Honorable mentions: Deng, Marco, E’Twaun, the Bench mob. * Amnestied Carlos Boozer way too late to be able to matter * Leaked that Kris Dunn apparently wasn’t working hard enough over the summer * Failed to see the writing on the wall and instead of rebuilding committed us to that meaningless three alphas year just to do the same thing in the end. * The entire Doug McDermott situation can be made into like eight bullets and is stupidly controversial among Bulls fans. But I know there will be stans in the comments so I will let them defend Garpax. * Trading 17 & 18 for 11 in the 2013 draft  \*Using #11 to draft Doug Mcderrmott in a good draft.  * Dumping Doug Mcderrmott just two years later for basically nothing. * Were incredibly late to the game of analytics, frequently downplaying its importance. * Kevin O’ Connor speculates that their promising to draft Chandler Hutchison restricted us from doing any draft night trades involving the #22 pick in 2018. Started our rebuild by selling a second- round pick. (We know Jordan Bell isn’t good, that’s never what this was about) * Third largest market in the NBA, paid the luxury tax twice. Traded for OPJ whose making 27 million and has played in 24/78 games available. If his girlfriend is reliable he’s also not a fan of the front office and a free agent in a year. * Horrible medical team. We’re always injured every single year. * Rosters frequently have big holes and they take bizarre steps to fix them. No Small Forward? Jabari. Need a long-term scoring option next to Rose? 33-year-old Rip Hamilton seems like a safe bet. (I love Rip but that doesn’t make it a good signing) Need a solid starting ball-handler & playmaker? Tomas Satorasnky, MCW, Jerian, Rondo seems like the wait maybe nvm. I know that you can’t nail every signing and not even all of these are bad. It’s more that there seems to be consistent gaps between how they evaluate talent & fit and that actually translates to the court. * 5 Playoff Series wins total in a 17-year tenure. * Had a Bulls doctor question Luol Deng about sitting out of games for a broken leg. * Dumped John Salmons and a first & second round pick to chase Lebron and ended up with nothing. * Trading Kirk Hinrich during his farewell tour for basically nothing. * Again, overruling Thibs when he liked Rudy Gobert for Tony Snell * Pulled the QO on David Nwaba for Jabari Parker. I feel like Nwaba while maybe not fantastic on his own fit really well with us. We’ve been a worse team since he left. * Misused Lauri basically his entire time here. Maybe not directly because of this but it’s now being rumored that he wants out. * Traded Taj Gibson in a year we made the playoffs for Cameron Payne & Joffrey Lavergne. * Failing to net any assets at the 2020 trade deadline. * IMO have had serious questions regarding their drafting ability since now Orlando Magic assistant GM left in 2012. * Are alleged to use the media to trash players and coaches by [Van Gundy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I4Y4VyDqrs)  ETA: - Dwade contract  * Couldn't build around Jimmy * Bad player development, everyone is regressing save Zach * Had coaches spy on coaches/players (Randy Brown) * Failed to make Chicago a FA destination * Inherited the prestige Jordan gave us, made us a joke. * Threatening to give Jimmy Butlers minutes to Tony Snell when he refused a contract extension."	0

But Wade never said anything about her transitioning, at least not completely, to my knowledge. Only that the name and pronouns used would be changed.  People conveniently ignored that in the thread on hereand started ranting about how wrong it was for a 12 year old to be put on horamone blockers or go through surgery when Wade never mentioned that.  He simply said they would respect her wishes and refer to her as she/her and by a female name. He also mentioned they would be talking to professionals about this and educating themselves.	1

"This is exactly what I'm talking about.   People think the accusations were disproved or that there was some sort of disagreement over the evidence.  Why exactly is unclear.  The only time Kobe challenged any of the factual accusations was when he thought he could make it go away by lying to the police when he was first arrested.   Rose confirmed every single piece of evidence brought up to him in the case.   All the Rose case proves is that its basically impossible to get a date rapist convicted in a criminal court because you can't prove mens rea even when you get the rapist to admit to it.  All they have to say is ""I thought she consented,"" regardless of whether there is a textbook's worth of evidence that she did not."	0

> but I'd give the benefit of the doubt to the guy running the best offense of all time  Not knocking Dallas because they are good, but they aren't even the best offense this year, in any category, how can they be the best offense of all time?  ninja: unless you are just talking about Ortg? I think that is not a good measurement personally (due to overall changes in league play, but fair enough.  another edit to doubly make sure I am clear:  ORTG is a great stat, I just don't think it is good to try and compare teams over different eras. The Mavs have a pace of ~98.something, which is like 5th best this year, with the Houston and MIL both having a much higher pace on slightly lower efficiency. '82 Nuggets is like the perfect example of the mixture of pace and efficiency. They put up 600 more points than the second most points of all time. If they had any semblance of a defense, they may have never lost, lol.	1

I guess it is the purpose of this post, use the gravity argument to tell us KD scoring was just Steph impact or Steph was just the most impactful player. KD doesnt need Steph to score 50 points. And if you think KD is an afterthought go look at what Lou Williams and Pat Bev said about defending KD in this series. Every top point god has that type of gravity, the problem is that they don't have a playmaker like Draymond to make them pay. Just take James harden and Lilliard. Harden get double team all the team but when he gives the ball to Tucker, the ball stays stuck and there is no action. Or take Lilliard against the pelicans in the playoffs, he got double teamed all serie by jrue and rondo, and when he gives the ball nobody knows how to move the ball to find the open man. So those plays that draymond does ain't easy and few power forwad can make it. So this gravity is effective also because of draymond ability to make each time the right play.  I am sure Steph gravity is a real thing but don't tell me he was the best player in this serie.	0

I feel like you are missing the point Jeremy Lin was trying to make. Blaming China does not alleviate the issue that USA failed to properly respond to the situation. Banning flights was supposed to give the US time to prepare for the epidemic, but they failed miserably. The virus does not care about race. It does not care about politics, sex, religion, or whatever. It cares about 1 thing. The human race. And as humans, we need to come together.   >It doesn’t have to be flashy or heroic. Choosing light could just be checking on a friend who is mentally struggling. It could be showing extra appreciation for your delivery person or standing up for someone who is being bullied. Sharing positivity or supporting your favorite local bookstore or restaurant during this hard time. It could even just be honoring a lockdown or stopping yourself from posting a hateful comment online.  >The road ahead won’t be easy. There will be times when it feels like the darkness is too much. Each day when the death tolls climb, when the unemployment rates continue to surge, when the next news story of a hate crime breaks, it might feel as if the negativity is insurmountable.  >But please, if you’re feeling hopeless, even right now, remember you’re not alone in this. We will grieve together, we will adapt together, and eventually we will thrive together. At the end of all this, we will take a long look in the mirror, and we won’t be able to lie to ourselves about how we acted.   >I believe we’ll be proud of what we see.   >Each act of goodness matters. Each positive choice will add up.  >In adversity, we will persevere. In challenges, we will overcome. In fear, we will have faith. And in darkness, we will be Light.	0

They werent necessarily going to trade him my dude, Iggy just forced that option.

Dude doesnt even show up to training camp, has a shit attitude, complains that he isnt being bought out and is now trying to tank his trade value by stating he only wants to play on the LA teams.  What a nice guy!	1
You're right. Nobody believed teams with top defenses, that gave LeBron's teams significant matchup problems, or had a fucking MVP would beat his team.   I don't understand the need to rewrite history. His teams were always favorites but to say nobody thought those other teams had a shot is fucking ridiculous.	0

dude was literally in the middle of a FEDERAL CASE because he was gambling illegally at that time and he lied to the NBA about it. they found out when the feds came knocking and MJ had to go to court and testify against his old bookie (taking tons of illegal bets) to save his own ass. his bookie was on trial and he had a lot of MJ's checks that were 6 figure checks. MJ initially said the checks were forged but when under oath he admitted that he had given him teh checks for gambling debts.  THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER LAWYER FOUND DEAD ON A GOLF COURSE WITH ANOTHER 6 FIGURE CHECK FROM MJ IN HIS POCKET. never heard of anything coming from that  another guy wrote a book with proof that he had won $900,000 from MJ via golf.  his dad was just killed and to this day there is no evidence linking either person in jail to the crime.   a book written about the whole thing figures the mob killed his dad because him and MJ were doing shady shit that was fucking them out of money. MJ with his gambling and they thought pops was a drug mule.  his dad was convicted of embezzlement right when MJ was drafted into the NBA, as well  MJ's family is kind of nothing but crooks and gangster-wannabes and that's why he acted the way he did. he wasn't mentally tough and ultra prepared, he was ultra-talented and nothing but a dickhead shyster	0

Vince was an elite player for 10 years and a very good player and legitimately important piece for the Magic and Mavs. The NJ, Orlando, and Dallas teams were highly competitive and just didn't quite have the same firepower that a few other teams had during his prime years. I believe he should be a Hall of Famer, although he will never be regarded in the same light as other greats of his era, and rightfully so. He strikes me as the Superstar-esque tier. During his true prime you had guys like KG, Kobe, Dirk, Duncan, Tmac, etc. that were on the truly elite level,  he was second tier, but that doesn't mean he wasn't great.	0
I was never really high on either, but dwight did lead a team to the finals. Embiid seems like he needs to grow up a bit more (kinda same with old dwight?) but embiid seems like he really wanta to win. Dwight seemed to lack that according to alot of his teamates pre lebrons lakers. That all being said, id take dwight. This could easily change if joels team situation changes and he can play more in the post and take less 3s.	0

I think the most stark example of a star player's departure having an immediate postive impact is Elgin Baylor. He retired 9 games into the 71-72 season. Immediately after his retirement (literally the first game without him) the Lakers commenced their historic 33 game win streak and took home the chip.	0
I watched this game and finals from a jail cell... kind of sucked but I realized history was happening as it was. Seeing JR give the game away truly changed the course of history in my opinion.

Corona Virus is a group of diseases (well viruses to be exact) that only poses threat to people that have weakened immune systems, have another major disease meaning babies, very sick people, and old people with deteriorated overall health.  No NBA player (assuming all of them without any major diseases) is in danger of ever getting fully sick from the Corona virus. They might get affected and be a carrier, but none of them are at risk of dying (since that's what most people are concerned about).  And to the people thinking guys like Embiid are at a higher risk - Physically injured a lot =/= prone to diseases. Guys who eat ass or get dirty with the strippers are at more risk than the guys who get muscle tears or knee problems.	1

I never really understood this line of thinking. The poster you’re responding too clearly believes that by his inaction, Trump is responsible for the deaths and illness of many people. Why would he be “just as bad or worse” for wishing him dead? Were the American citizens who wanted Bin Laden dead after 9/11 just as bad or worse as Bin Laden? I can kind of see it as like a situational thing maybe, like ‘Well they have similar indifference about the sanctity of life that could lead them to make the same decisions if the circumstances were flipped.’ I don’t know tho, it’s hard for me to wrap my head around the ethical reasoning you use to come to that conclusion, and I’m totally open to hearing and trying to better understand that line of thinking if you’re willing to explain a bit	0

">You have not debunked a single thing in that video. The only thing you proved is that the word soon is technically true if you want to be generous and include that we will have it by next flu season.   I'll keep copying and pasting until you address it.   LMAO okay man. The video is nothing but bullshit. The virus wasn't a big deal in America mid January at that point. No need for revisionist history. Saying that most people will get better is TRUE. Saying that it will likely be over soon is TRUE. Saying there are treatments and vaccines coming soon is TRUE. Like the majority of what he said in there is factually correct. Why can't you understand that? He has taken the measures necessary to get this under control. It's also his job to not fucking spread panic and throw us into anarchy.  Literally a week before Trump said he didn't think it was a pandemic in January the WHO was saying that human to human transmission of the disease was not happening. The entire fucking world wasn't taking it seriously at that point.  >Comparing to regular drugs development is a strawman. His intent was not ""dont worry we will have a vaccine within 12 years""  His intent is that we will have something to fight the virus in the near future. Having a vaccine ready by next flu season is fucking soon man i dont give a fuck what you say. Keep ignoring the fact that therapeutic treatments are available already. Doesn't fit your retarded narrative.  >That was a total of what 5-7 seconds of the video. How about the other 2:05? The video is date stamped, it is not trying to skew what he said, even said there are only 8 cases in America at the time. That does not dismiss the criticism of him saying ""we have shut it down"" while cases were on the rise in January, not does it address the other 95% of the video.  I addressed most of it in my previous comments. Please read slower.  >Your link about test kits having the hiccup (which I cant even read because you linked a website that forces you to create an account) does not dismiss the criticism of him saying ""as of yesterday and today anyone can get a test"" These test production errors occurred in February, it was known at the time we did not have enough tests and he lied about it.  How does it fucking not? Companies preparing and shipping tests tell trump they are ready and how many will be available now and in the future. Trump then says they're available. Then you have the issues come up. Is it that hard to follow dude?  >Now we are on to whataboutisms. I am not a fan of any of the people you have named. I have never voted democrat in my life and am just as critical to them as I am Trump. Wish you were too, but your likely part of the Trump cult who are political hacks who consistently trash the media for being fake news but never Trump who is one of the largest providers of it.  DGAF who you voted for. You would be surprised who I voted for in the past but that's completely irrelevant. Doesn't make your retarded logic any better. It's not whataboutism, it's admitting that the dude isn't perfect but that video is bullshit and is overplaying any apparent mishandling of the virus.   >Please show me where you debunked that Trump did not say cases are going to go down in late February when there were 80K+ cases in the world?  Talking about the vaccines. What he said there was flat out wrong and I already said as such.  >If you reread what I wrote, I specifically said Trump did not say this just that he consistently endorses the people who made those dangerous claims. I said people at Fox went even further than Trump did. I did not say Trump said it was a hoax nor that he praised their specific response to the hoax. The favorite network of the guy who consistently says ""fake news"" were endangering people with their careless reporting on the virus.  Such an absurd way to attempt to attach something to Trump it's not worthy of a response."	0

Lebrons teammates screwed him SO HARD at the end of that game. Here’s the final play made by every starter besides Lebron.  Kevin Love - On the play before the Hill free throws the Cavs are winning by 2. Kevin Love makes one of the most disgusting soft fouls ever. Probably the worst foul committed in the history of the Cavs franchise, given what it meant. Steph gets an EASY and 1 to put them up by 1. This foul was literally just as bad as the Ginobili v Dirk foul but nobody remembers it because of what else happened.  George Hill - next play Hill misses the FT. Now I’m not too mad about this because that’s fucking hard to do, making both free throws in that situation. Idc if it’s MJ, KD, Dirk, or anyone in between. Hitting free throws at the end of a finals game is Not easy. That being said he’s still an 80% FT shooter who missed.  JR Smith - didn’t know the score of the game somehow,, and then lied about it, also tried to point the finger at Lebron.  Tristan - tried to start a fight with Draymond  If Lebron didn’t know he was leaving,he knew after that. Literally every starter besides him did something retarded to end that game.	0

"> It's annoying that they're dismissive  Dismissive of what? I think maybe how they're categorizing it is what bothers you?   > I don't know if they realize that roughly half my male friends are gay.  That's not possible unless you basically only socialize within a gay community? Gays comprise less than 5% of the world's population.  > They specifically called it ""weird"" and weren't as intense as banning it from discussion.  Again, I think it's just the terminology they're using that bothers you since ""weird"" has a certain connotation to it that you're sensitive too.  Like I said before, if you want to keep things technical... homosexuality is considered *abnormal* behavior. However, it does exist in nature.. thus it is *natural* to an extent.

A few thoughts while watching the game:  * The defensive intensity was off the charts * Brook Lopez is a beast patrolling the paint - the forays into the paint by Lowry/FVV were absolutely annhilated by him (and as a salty fan: past 3 seconds a lot of times!) * And god does Brook love shitting on the Raps from 3. Also when did Robin start hitting 3s?! * Wow were the starters ice cold. Everyone shat on Ibaka and Lowry in the post-game thread, but FVV was hot garbage too * Not sure why OG didn't play. He was the only starter hitting his shots, and he was holding his own against Giannis pretty damn well * When did Ilyasova stop getting playing time?? * Holy shit Bud does 239048230948240629752093852 subs a game. Is this some kind of strategy to make the game slower and get more rest? It was also one of the longest games I've been to this season. * Giannis had FVV on him multiple times and passed it out - it was kind of weird. * Boucher and RHJ and Matt Thomas brought it. TDii too (though he also started ice cold - 0/5) * Raptors need Bucks-killer Norm in * Middleton is so damn good * Eric Bledsoe looke WAY better than he did in the playoffs vs the Raptors * Marvin Williams was a solid addition * This [image best describes the Raptors yesterday](https://preview.redd.it/pramgghgr6j41.jpg?width=960&auto=webp&s=63402faa16a5a6b630c997ba27ceb76b7e1ca989)   Overall - Raps great D, meh offense (horrible by starters). Bucks fantastic interior D, solid O, and everyone played so unselfishly.  If FVV had hit that three pointer off the steal (which I hated because of how far he was AND how cold he was), that would have made things *crazy*.	1

Bro you Celtics fans are delusional AF. The Rockets fan is right, and I'm not even a Harden or Rockets fan.  I checked the stats, Harden puts up almost twice as many points, more than twice as many assists, and is assisted on 14.1% of his 3's whereas Tatum is assisted on 61.1% of his 3's.  Harden is a far more efficient volume scorer, putting up far more points on higher percentages from everywhere (Ft, paint, mid 2, long 2), the only place Harden is below Tatum in efficiency is assisted field goals.  Harden also does all this while putting up 35.2 ppg over Tatums 22.2ppg on a higher EFP.  Harden Shooting Stats by distance   .534  .650  .398  .480  .500  .356 (Harden is assisted on .141 of his 3's)  Tatum Shooting Stats by distance   .473  .602  .373  .410  .375  .387 (Tatum is assisted on .611 of his 3's)  Oh and Assist to TOV% 1.64 for Harden and 1.35 for Tatum.  There is practically no comparison between the two players whatsoever.  Harden is a far more efficient scorer and assister with heavy ball usage volume scorer putting up 35.2ppg and 7.3apg.  Tatum is a below average creator, below average shooter, but is an above average catch and shoot 3pt shooter putting up 22.2ppg and 2.9apg.  Oh, and as for consistency, Harden appears to be far more consistent without doing the advanced math, he literally goes 3 months without dropping below 23 points in a game while his FG% sits in the 15.4% and 66.7%. His worst game being 12 points on 13 fg's.  Tatum's consistency is notably worse, his FG% jumps between 5.6% and 80.0%, while his worst game was 5 points on 18 fg's.	1
She is young and healthy. She will be JUST FINE. Like the rest of the players and personnel that contracted it. Overblown and over hyped.	0
I didn't play, but I'm from southern Indiana and my local high school played Washington in sectionals one year, which is the school all of the Zeller brothers came through. Cody was there at this point, and he had a really quiet first half, just grabbed a bunch of boards and had maybe 10 points. We were up going into halftime, not by much, but we were up. I think Cody had like 25 points in the second half, nobody could do anything to stop him, grabbed every rebound, pretty much everything he put up dropped. Tom Crean was there scouting and everyone knew it was for Cody, I'm pretty sure it was his senior year	0

> A) Again, talking about naming and not priority. You should work on your reading skills bud.  I like how you've gone from 'policy priority' to 'priority', and somehow I'm the one who can't read.    >B) Lmao. Enlighten me on CCP history, please, since you seem to know so much.  CCP history is pretty irrelevant to this discussion, but I have laid out the distinction between 'China' and 'the CPP' (something which actually is relevant to this discussion) in a previous post. You should work on your reading skills bud.    >C) Yes, absolutely. All adults choose whether we want to live under and support our government or leave.  You... really believe that every adult in the world has the ability to just up and leave their country if they want to?  Holy shit you are clueless about how the world works.    >D) For someone so pompous, you really seem to not know shit.  Lol, riiiight, I'm the one who's being a dick and looking completely clueless in this discussion.  Keep telling yourself that.	0
