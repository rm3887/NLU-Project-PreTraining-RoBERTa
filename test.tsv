the bare minimum the nba can do is shut down, donate all the money they have to vanessa, and then start a new league called the NMA - national mamba association, and all players must legally change their name to kobe bryant and use steroids and augmentations to look and play exactly like him  anything less is just disrespectful	1

It's not the same as the grandma scenario, stop using it. Kobe is commanding someone to surrender their seat, totally different from your grandma asking you politely if she can have your seat. Also Kobe is an athlete who can afford to stand the whole game if he needs to, or just wait for someone to bring another seat, not a grandma who probably cant stand for more than a few minutes without a lot of discomfort.	1

That's great. When does the season come back tho? 🙏	0
I think it's just a testament to how out of control it is.   Obviously what everyone wants to happen is they take every precaution they can and the season starts back up again. And another option (that nobody wants) is that the season just ends entirely. But what really really \*cannot\* happen is that they try to restart, they set a date, they even play a couple games... and then somebody gets it and they have to shut down again. That just cannot happen. And the fact that it's already so out of control and we have no real clue when it's going to be in control I think makes people more and more think they'll have to shut things down.	0

But Wade never said anything about her transitioning, at least not completely, to my knowledge. Only that the name and pronouns used would be changed.  People conveniently ignored that in the thread on hereand started ranting about how wrong it was for a 12 year old to be put on horamone blockers or go through surgery when Wade never mentioned that.  He simply said they would respect her wishes and refer to her as she/her and by a female name. He also mentioned they would be talking to professionals about this and educating themselves.	1

2011 LeBron playing better obviously results in a 3peat, although people should give the Mavs more credit they were an AWESOME team. But they also could’ve won in 2014 if Wade still had knees and the team outside LeBron performed. I think the real answer is that if they’d been able to get together a couple years sooner they’d have had a higher peak and longer domination. Actual Prime Wade with Prime LeBron.	0
I think he did experience racism, but then it got to the point where people were saying all of his struggles were due to 'racism.'  Those news articles like the 'chink in the armor' and 'women in NYC about to feel couple of inches of pleasure tonight' were absurdly racist. And honestly he probably got profiled every time he was asked to show his credentials when he was walking into the stadium with teammates.  But then you got people saying the reason he's not in the league anymore was because of racism, and that the refs were racist towards him	1

">People think that it's supposed to be this miracle of science, a perfect shield against one of the most mutable viruses in existence. It's not.  No one thinks it's a perfect shield. But it's essentially a ""if you can help yourself and possibly prevent yourself from coming down with the flu,"" then why not get the vaccine. There's very rarely a serious reaction to the vaccine unless you have an egg allergy, but I don't even think this an issue anymore in the inactivated flu vaccine over the live attenuated.  People shouldn't look at the flu vaccine as a 'damned if you do, damned if you don't"" option. The researchers who develop the vaccine rely heavily on epidemiological data and attempt to 'beat the flu' to the punch, so that by time the virus has spread to the US, in this case, people have received the vaccine and developed a strong immunity to it.  But as you've pointed out, the flu can mutate/undergo antigenic shift so that the annual strain is different year in, year out. It's not a perfect solution.  But stating:  >Healthy adults in their prime don't need it.  is really not helpful and severely understates the vaccine's effectiveness."	1

Also I’m sure 5 users are all just 1 guy.        Bucks are misunderstood. I like them.      Sixers are the same as the bucks.       Celtics I hate but respect.      Lakers are angels.

I am saying of the **top rebounders in the NBA** and you're comparing Giannis' rebounding statistics to Lebron, Harden, and Westbrook?  &#x200B;  Top 5 Rebounders:  &#x200B;  Drummond @ 15. 8 REB  Gobert @ 14.6 REB  Whiteside @ 14 REB  Capela @ 13.8 REB  Giannis @ 13.4 REB  [https://stats.nba.com/players/rebounding/?sort=REB&dir=1](https://stats.nba.com/players/rebounding/?sort=REB&dir=1)  &#x200B;  Top 5 Contested Rebounders:  &#x200B;  Drummond @ 7.3 C. REB  Whiteside @ 6.8 C. REB  Capela @ 6.6 C. REB  Gobert @ 5.3 C. REB  Wendell Carter Jr. @ 5.3 C. REB  **Giannis is #16 at 4.4 C.

Of the top 5 rebounders, Giannis is by far the lowest in both the contested and offensive rebounding categories. Giannis is #5 in total rebounds, #16 at contested rebounds, and #29 at offensive rebounds. Compare that to Drummond who is #1 in all 3 categories, Capela who is #4 total rebounds, #3 contested, and #2 offensive, etc.	1

Woj has humiliated r/nba and r/Lakers so much in the last year that they still haven’t recovered, thus anytime he mentions the Lakers it’s just hate.

Probably the most fascinating case of sports based cognitive dissonance I’ve ever seen.   We should contact Iggy and have Harvard do a case study on this instead, lol.	1

Hayward was a legit All-Star his last year in Utah. He didn't play great last year because he was recovering from an injury but if you look at his level of play now he's definitely capable of performing like a star when his team needs him to. He's only averaging 17 points but he's doing it on 52% from the field and 37% from three. He is sort of being penalized by people for his unselfishness since he isn't putting up star numbers but he's doing exactly what his team needs him to do. He's easily capable of putting up big stats when needed. Just look at his last 3 games.	1

He did, and he did so more than Pippen.  Contrary to popular opinion, Michael Jordan – not Scottie Pippen –   most often drew the opposition’s toughest perimeter assignment. However,  it was close: Jordan did so 8 times, while Scottie Pippen assumed this  responsibility 7 times.     ***After reviewing the game film from the  1991 NBA Finals, it turns out the Jordan – not Pippen – guarded Magic  Johnson for nearly 85-90% of that series. The exception was the first  half of Game 2 and the 2H of Game 3.***     **Out of 24 playoff  series, Michael Jordan – not Scottie Pippen -guarded the better   perimeter player more often. Specifically,Jordan guarded the better  perimeter player during 13 playoff series, while Pippen guarded the  better perimeter player 11 times.**     So Pippen only guarded  Magic for 2 halves....and yet most people think he guarded him most of  the series. Its amazing what some highlights, reputation, and word of  mouth can do.     I would say 1998 is a tie tho, I know Reggie was the Pacers best player but Pippen guarded Mark Jackson which was crucial....     But still it is a HUGE myth that Pippen mostly guarded the other teams best player.	0

I wouldn't say that. Auto-rotation in essence is just using airflow through the blades to give them energy, since the blades are being given energy it also means the fall is retarded. On approach to the ground the pilot changes the angle of the blades to generate lift and this quickly depletes the inertial energy built up. Too soon and you run out of energy and begin falling, and land with excessive speed (crash). Too late and you don't retard your fall enough and crash. There are also a lot more conditions and failures that can prevent a successful auto-rotation.	1

"I dont think anyone who has the choice between a sink w/ soap and hand sanitizer is arguing hand sanitizer does it better. what IS being argued is when sink w/ soap isnt nearby, sanitizer IS a safe and convenient option to use when 60% alc or more. running down halls or to another building or wherever its obviously not convenient is not good advice when you have a reliable method in hand sanitizer.  shitposting up and down saying ""wash your hands!!!!!"" in response to saying hand sanitizer works on a post about hand sanitizer not working is stupid. if its convenient and right there, wash your hands. If its not convenient and you have hand sanitizer, use a healthy amount and youre fine. if anything opening door handles out of the bathroom that carry germs is far more dangerous to risk than hands free squirts from a bottle that can air dry where you sit. no navigating or grabbing of door handles required at your desk or whatever. neither option is bad, but going out of your way to find a sink w/soap because you refuse hand sanitizer is retarded."	0

"It's all the same thing. What he said isn't even the PC version. In black culture a man being ""feminine,"" ""a bitch,"" ""having female tendencies,"" or just outright being called gay are all the same.

I've had many conversations like that. When I told my fam that they are men that go through the process of being defined as a woman that still date women they just couldn't compute.

He was the first unanimous mvp who continued his stellar play until that finals series, he averaged more turnovers than assists as the PG and scored much less than what he was showing in every other part of that season, hows that disingenuous? Name another season or series he had more turnovers than assists  A high turnover player? What stats do you have to back that up lol, he averaged 4.3 TO per game, which is more than any season he’s had. We both saw that behind the back pass into the stands in a crucial moment of game 7  I don’t think it’s delusional at all, he went from 30.1/5.4/6.7 on 50/45/91 with 3.3 TO per game to 22.6/4.9/3.7 40/40/93 with 4.3 TO per game , that’s a huge drop off for a unanimous mvp.   Stats don’t even do it justice, it looked clear when he lost his cool and threw his mouthpiece at a fan. It’s not hate haha, I like him but I’m not blindly defending him like yourself	0

It’s incredible, I’m having a completely tongue in cheek argument with one of them and he’s taking me completely seriously when I’m telling him that Perkins would’ve made up a 30 point deficit, it’s unreal how dense they are lol, they don’t see that I’m just spewing the same bullshit argument that they’re saying for Bynum	1

I mean, there’s definitely been other bad presidents. I don’t like Trump, but he’s not any worse than the others, he’s just worse at not getting caught. Anyone who works their way to that position is covering some very, VERY sketchy things. He’s just the worst at hiding them. Everyone who has a firm belief in a politician has to overlook things. It’s a matter of what things someone can overlook. Some people can overlook the racism because it lines their pockets. Some people were able to overlook Obama jailing whistle blowers because it furthered their agenda, and people were able to overlook Bush’s non-reaction then subsequent over reaction to 9/11, Clinton getting a hummer, Regan selling weapons against Congress’ wishes and so on, because it furthers their plots. My point is they’re all terrible. Not one single politician is out to help the people. The ones who say they are, are not. If they were, they would be doing something positive with their time and their life instead of driving a wedge into society over partisan politics.  They’re out to make a buck, like we all are. The problem is their dollar comes at the expense of roughly half the people they represent.	0

Here's WHO's recommendation to avoid naming it after geographic groups (among other criteria) https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2015/naming-new-diseases/en/  Honestly, I can't believe we are even having this conversation. It should really take a quantum of empathy to realize why these names should be avoided, especially considering that (a) we already have both other names that have been widely accepted, and (b) I could see Wuhan Coronavirus (though I'd avoid it), but Chinese Virus doesn't even many sense--we don't refer to Ebola by The Congo Virus.  It's quite obvious what Trump is doing. He's trying to distract from his failings by sowing resentment against China. And I'd say M.O. involves primarily sowing racial resentment. That's not surprising, given it's a trick that worked in 2016.  But I hate it. That press conference today was simply gross. Just like his commercial for Wall Street last Friday in front of the rose garden.	0

"Easy for you to say bro. Think of the trauma experienced by these guys. Put yourself in the shoes of someone like KD, or Spida: no cough, no fever, no congestion, no shortness of breath, no fatigue, no pneumonia, no symptoms. Seems like everything is ok, right? Well, check your privilege right there asshole, because not only did they have to hear from a doctor that they have it which is SUPER SCARY (yikes!), theres also a very good chance that they will also be affected by the guilt forever--knowing that they passed this on to other people who may *also* go on to not develop a cough, fever, congestion, shortness of breath, pneumonia, or any other symptoms. And then THOSE people could pass it on to others, who will again, develop no symptoms. Before you know it, everyone under 70 in this country will be walking around with this not even knowing they have it, while 85 year olds will be dropping dead in the hospital with respiratory diseases and heart problems to the tune of slightly below average flu season numbers.

Dictatorship under Napoleon? Time to check your facts. Napoleon brought with him sweeping social reforms, introduced a civil code which to this day serves as the basis of many countries’ legal system, created high schools, created the Bank of France, brought back exiled nobles, brought back freedom of religion, and undertook vast successful military conquests which consolidated his country as the premier power in Europe. And if it weren’t for him, Italy and Germany probably wouldn’t exist, as his wars led to a surge in nationalism in these areas. Sure, there was some control over the press, and he brought back slavery in the colonies, but the highs far outweigh the lows. The truth is the majority of the French people adored Napoleon.	0

Affirm the hierarchy and pecking order. Punish stupidity.  I go back and forth.  On the one hand, it’s insane and abusive, on the other it kind of saved my life.   First time I ever got shot at I froze. Dropped behind a pile of rubble while an insurgent just unloaded into it. I couldn’t move.  Heard a voice of my team leader - a voice I had grown to respect, fear, AND immediately respond to.  He used hazing too.  I responded immediately and did what he said. I’m still here.   War is fucked and it takes serious reprogramming to make people willing to do the shit they had us do over there.   All of that is so fucked up lol.  I guess when I say “I go back and forth”, it’s in the context of “literally none of this should happen but since it’s reality and it is happening, maybe it’s a necessary evil within that construct”.	1

"Oh hell yeah brother, I totally hear you! Really like your description, and I would even go as far to say Dirks ring is THE most valuable off all time (at least that I have witnessed).  But i also think the KD narrative is greatly overblown, Steph was still just as impactful in those playoffruns and I just can't fault someone for bringing in the 2nd best player in the league when you have the chance to do so.  And if you go with the Asterisk for his first then you have to start putting one to every single other title (like Lebrons the year after, because of the Green suspension).  In short I firmly believe Stephs 3 rings combined outweigh Dirks, although I will admit, ""greatly"" may just be a tad bit too much."	0

"Was careful to avoid those exact words.  I am just so fed up with this bullshit. Many of those NBA reporters probably want to stay up to date and read r/nba click a link about their work and read the worst crap, written by some embarrassing losers. It's one thing to constructively criticise lacking work or a bad take. But why does Windhorst, who does a lot of great work, get constantly shat on? For what reason in this world do people hate on Shelbourne, MacMullan and Doris Burke?  I get when people constantly hold a person with real influence or power accountable. Trump for his terrible presidency, Lebron for his Hongkong comments or Mark Cuban for the sexual harrasment scandal within the Mavs organisation. But an online crusade against a reporter who asked a disagreeable question on a shaky premise, really?  I am absolutely serious with my following assumption: ""Many of those little fuckers, had they any power in society later, would put on some black uniforms, march the streets, surpress women and straw man minorities to finally gas a few millions people."""	0

Wade no doubt. This isn’t even a question. Whoever says KD is fucking retarded and only started watching basketball within the past few years   People forget KD was just a tall James harden before he joined a 73 win team that won a title and made 3 finals without him. His playoff efficiency ALWAYS drastically dipped compared to the regular season and he always had his worse series in the biggest games and moments   KD **WISHES** he could have have the run Dwade had in 2006   Put Dwade on those warriors teams instead of KD and they would have gone 16-0, 16-1 in both of their playoff runs  Put Trevor Ariza on those teams instead of KD and they still win at least 1 title lol that’s how stacked KDs team was   If this was asked in 2016 it would be overwhelmingly wade. It’s sad that so many retarded people got duped by KD on golden state thinking he could perform like that in the playoffs on any other team.

"Anfernee Simons is a young guy for whom many had high hopes, but has underperformed this season. At one point in the season, he was the first guard off the bench, but this place has been taken by Gary Trent, who has shown much better shooting and defense for the TrailBlazers. Coach Stotts has taken to staggering Dame and CJ's minutes rather than rely on this rather raw PG to run the offense.  But before we give up on him, there are three things to remember. First, he is very, very young for a second year player. He's only 20, but looks about 16. Secondly, he is physically gifted with great ""hops"" and sufficient quickness. And finally, he is playing behind a couple of the best, most cerebral PGs in the league, players who are known for their intelligence and willingness to help others achieve.  Of course, playing behind Dame and CJ could retard his development as well. He has never really been called to be ""the Man"" except for one unusual game at the end of last season. But if you are looking for someone with high potential but has been written off lately, you could do worse than taking a flyer on Anfernee."	1

It doesn’t fall under the homophobic category but the thing about that Marcus Morris feminine quote last month that stood out was how willing and unhesitant he was to say something like that on record publicly. Don’t think it even occurred to him till like hours later on the issue with what he said was he literally said it to a female reporter. If they type of dialogue amongst players has become so normalized players will casually just spill it publicly and only realize it was bad later you just imagine what gets said behind closed doors all the time as part of regular discourse	1
with all due respect, if you yourself acknowledge you haven't done any research on the topic, maybe you should just listen when people who have read the research that other people *have* done are talking about it?   there are potential side effects that may impact fertility and bone density, but for the majority of trans people ive ever spoken with the consensus opinion is that it's absolutely well worth those slight and rare risks compared to struggling with gender dysphoria that can be heavily intensified by changes brought on by puberty, most of which would require a lot more work to reverse or modify surgically after they have already occurred (if the individual decides to transition later in life)	1

For pretext: I live in Canada. The reported China numbers were scary in February (80K). https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china/   Some countries chose not to act, some chose to take some weak measures (e.g. Canada), then there are countries like Taiwan. If 2-3 countries did a good job (e.g. Taiwan and Singapore), other Countries (especially the 1st world countries) have no excuse.  &nbsp;  In Chinese culture, they work to appease their boss, the yes-man culture. In the COVID-19 case, I do think the suppression started on the state level. A bunch of senior state officials got fired, not low level states people. https://www.businessinsider.com/analysis-china-hubei-officials-sacked-xi-jinping-protected-2020-2 Though this doesn't have to be the case all the time. For example, the milk powder suppression during the Beijing Olympics is on the federal level.   &nbsp;  For your next point, on the suppression causing the initial Wuhan out-break. I agree with this.

I'll keep copying and pasting until you address it.   LMAO okay man. The video is nothing but bullshit. The virus wasn't a big deal in America mid January at that point. No need for revisionist history. Saying that most people will get better is TRUE. Saying that it will likely be over soon is TRUE. Saying there are treatments and vaccines coming soon is TRUE. Like the majority of what he said in there is factually correct. Why can't you understand that? He has taken the measures necessary to get this under control. It's also his job to not fucking spread panic and throw us into anarchy.  Literally a week before Trump said he didn't think it was a pandemic in January the WHO was saying that human to human transmission of the disease was not happening. The entire fucking world wasn't taking it seriously at that point.  >Comparing to regular drugs development is a strawman. His intent was not ""dont worry we will have a vaccine within 12 years""  His intent is that we will have something to fight the virus in the near future. Having a vaccine ready by next flu season is fucking soon man i dont give a fuck what you say. Keep ignoring the fact that therapeutic treatments are available already. Doesn't fit your retarded narrative.  >That was a total of what 5-7 seconds of the video. How about the other 2:05? The video is date stamped, it is not trying to skew what he said, even said there are only 8 cases in America at the time. That does not dismiss the criticism of him saying ""we have shut it down"" while cases were on the rise in January, not does it address the other 95% of the video.  I addressed most of it in my previous comments. Please read slower.  >Your link about test kits having the hiccup (which I cant even read because you linked a website that forces you to create an account) does not dismiss the criticism of him saying ""as of yesterday and today anyone can get a test"" These test production errors occurred in February, it was known at the time we did not have enough tests and he lied about it.  How does it fucking not? Companies preparing and shipping tests tell trump they are ready and how many will be available now and in the future. Trump then says they're available. Then you have the issues come up. Is it that hard to follow dude?  >Now we are on to whataboutisms. I am not a fan of any of the people you have named. I have never voted democrat in my life and am just as critical to them as I am Trump. Wish you were too, but your likely part of the Trump cult who are political hacks who consistently trash the media for being fake news but never Trump who is one of the largest providers of it.  DGAF who you voted for. You would be surprised who I voted for in the past but that's completely irrelevant. Doesn't make your retarded logic any better. It's not whataboutism, it's admitting that the dude isn't perfect but that video is bullshit and is overplaying any apparent mishandling of the virus.   >Please show me where you debunked that Trump did not say cases are going to go down in late February when there were 80K+ cases in the world?  Talking about the vaccines. What he said there was flat out wrong and I already said as such.  >If you reread what I wrote, I specifically said Trump did not say this just that he consistently endorses the people who made those dangerous claims. I said people at Fox went even further than Trump did. I did not say Trump said it was a hoax nor that he praised their specific response to the hoax. The favorite network of the guy who consistently says ""fake news"" were endangering people with their careless reporting on the virus.  Such an absurd way to attempt to attach something to Trump it's not worthy of a response."	0

It wouldn't matter who you put around him. He's selfish. He doesn't inspire greatness. You can't be both.   You can be Kobe and be a ball hog but drive those around you.

I cannot think or comprehend of anything more cucked than having a daughter. Honestly, think about it rationally. You are feeding, clothing, raising and rearing a girl for at least 18 years solely so she can go and get ravaged by another man. All the hard work you put into your beautiful little girl - reading her stories at bedtime, making her go to sports practice, making sure she had a healthy diet, educating her, playing with her. All of it has one simple result: her body is more enjoyable for other men. Raised the perfect girl? Great. Who benefits? If you're lucky, a random man who had nothing to do with the way she grew up, who marries her. He gets to ravage her every night. He gets the benefits of her kind and sweet personality that came from the way you raised her. As a man who has a daughter, you are LITERALLY dedicating at least 20 years of your life simply to raise a girl for another man to enjoy. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck. Think about it logically.	0

Doubt you will look into this, you'll probably just keep your head in the sand. 2009, 4g roll out. Swine Flu outbreak. 3g rolled out in 2001 - SARS outbreak 2002. Radio towers massively rolled out. Radio towers massively rolled out in 1910 - Spanish Flu outbreak in 1912.   5G rolled out....first in Wuhan China. 2nd in Spain. Third in Italy. Then the US (major port cities..NY, LA, Seattle).   Do you see a pattern? It may be nothing, but it is absolutely a pattern worth looking at.  The WHO seems radio frequency radiation as carcinogenic.  5G is used in WEAPON SYSTEMS for crowd control. 5G Network Uses Same EMF Waves As Pentagon Crowd Control System. ... Among the many potential problems with exposure to 5G radio waves are issues with the skin, which is interesting when you consider that this technology is already being used in the military for crowd control purposes.

because he gets a lot of uncontested team rebounds where either  someone (Lopez) boxing out is doing all the work or the other team is already running back to set their d.  &#x200B;  if he wasn't so good at bringing the ball up the floor, that wouldn't be the case so take that how you want. but of the top rebounders, i believe he has the lowest % of contested+offensive rebounds which is what great rebounders are usually remembered for.	1

The Rockets defense is good when they try which is a good sign for the playoffs.   It's funny how different defenses rank when you filter out bad teams from the equation and look at defenses vs top ~15 offenses. Some at the top shoot down, others lower ranked shoot up. Rockets are good they just dont always beat bad teams when they're supposed to.   Bucks, for example, go from the #1 overall defense to the #8 defense against the top 15 offenses,  Utah goes from #8 to #17. Rockets go from #15 to #10, which isn't amazing but for what their offense is rated that's really good to improve that much on D vs top offenses   Harden's D is actually insane now too, which is almost certainly because Russ takes a lot of his offensive energy expenditure	1

Not OP, but I remember in either Wilt’s or Russell’s autobiography one of them said Wilt would get pissed at one teammate in particular because every time he’d pass it to the guy he’d be wide open, then take one dribble before shooting.  That was all it would take for an assist to not count.	0

"> Your ""actual data"" is compiled by non public health / medical experts   The dataset they analyze actually comes from a joint effort between China and the WHO, which you can find here:  https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf  Are you saying the Doctors who shared this data with the WHO are not medical experts?  > they make a fundamental error which is that the dataset they use skews towards people who needed medical treatment (""laboratory confirmed cases"")  Laboratory confirmed means the infection was confirmed by a laboratory (experts) not that medical treatment was required.  China was aggressively testing people based on contact with others, not just when they felt ill. Asymptomatic cases are in fact part of the dataset and since China was at the forefront of the outbreak, this is the most comprehensive and long term (timeline) data set released to date.  Meanwhile the data you shared doesn’t really have long term symptomatic outcomes  because:  > Soon after identification of the first infections, both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases were transported to designated medical facilities specialised in infectious diseases in Japan. However, these patients were treated as external (imported) cases, and a detailed description of their clinical progression is not publicly available."	0
That is fucking retarded, I'm sorry. The Chinese Governemnt needs to be held responsible for this.

"Oh come on, the comment I responded to about funding for military but not for health is obviously a jab at conservative spending in general, healthcare (either socialized or ACA), or the CDC budget (or even all three). I then try as hard as possible to limit the scope of the argument to my point, that funding had not been cut (which it hasn't), then get told I'm wrong (which I'm not) while being told I'm straw-manning (how?).  I feel like most people think the response has been poor, but [Democrats literally wanted Trump to end the travel ban and thought it was overreaching](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/11/democrat-response-to-coronavirus-end-trumps-travel-bans-on-china-iran/) and [called it racist](https://www.wnd.com/2020/02/democrats-call-trumps-expansion-travel-ban-racist/), while actively trying to resist it. Coronavirus hasn't gotten anywhere as bad as H1N1 yet and I don't think depression-inducing panic is going to solve anything. Neither does appealing to some moral authority and politicizing a topic where, you personally should want good leadership and a calm attitude.  Trump has already tried to appropriately seek funding meanwhile Nancy Pelosi had the United States senate on lock from the middle of January into February, and then again when a coronavirus bill was trying to be passed she tried to sneak in a Hyde amendment exception [source](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/sasse-rips-pelosi-for-trying-to-smuggle-hyde-amendment-loophole-into-coronavirus-package/).

I'm gonna have a really hot take and expect to be downvoted but where was the panic and the outcry when the swine flu infected 60 million Americans and over 700+ million people worldwide in 2009-10? Where was the suspended seasons due to SARS, Ebola, bird flu, Zika,etc? Yes, I get it. There's no vaccine for COVID-19 but vaccines only help you get better if you get sick, it doesn't prevent you from getting it. The common flu is also more contagious than coronavirus. SARS is twice as contagious and no one here batted an eye when there was a SARS outbreak.  The vast majority of people that have died from COVID-19 are the same at-risk people for regular flu, ie elderly and people with compromised immune and respiratory systems. The weather is going to get warmer in a couple of months and you'll see this virus slowly die out and everything will be back to normal by summer. Count on it. It's a virus. It's not the second coming of the black plague. Take precautions, be safe, and everything will be alright.	1

Go look at Kawhis 4th quarter stats from each of the games in the 2019 finals.  Game 1 - 1 for 2 FGs  Game 2 - 1 for 6 FGs  Game 3 - 3 for 4 FGs  Game 4 - 1 for 2 FGs  Game 5 - 5 for 12 FGs   Game 6 (Closeout Game) - 0 for 4 FGs - 0 rebounds - 0 assists - 0 blocks - 0 steals.  Kawhi was pretty non existent in a lot of these 4th quarters. The closeout game he was pretty atrocious. We just don’t remember or care because his name isn’t Lebron. Can you imagine if Lebron had that stat line to close out a finals and his team won anyways? People still give Lebron shit over the Kyrie shot, even tho Lebron outscored him 11 to 5 and shot a better % in that quarter. VanVleet has 12, Siakem had 5 points, as many as Kyrie had.. and yet not a single person ever mentions it.   I’m not saying he can’t close, but he’s not this god level closer people pretend he is.	1

> Lol if you think there were legitimately no club house issues on the Celtics last year and that anything positive to say about Kyrie isn't anything but diplomacy  Jaylen Brown has straight up come out and said Kyrie gets way too much blame for their problems last season. I’m pretty sure I trust the players who are actually in the locker room more than you.  > Kyrie is so fucking overrated by you idiots it's crazy.   Imagine hurling insults because somebody disagrees with you about a basketball player. How old are you?  Get upset all you want, but you’re the one letting your personal feelings affect your opinion on him as a basketball player. When the players agree with me that Kyrie wasn’t the problem, and the front offices agree with me that they’d rather have Kyrie than DLo, I think it’s fair to say your opinion isn’t a very logical one.  >He joined a team that almost made the finals and they were worse the very next year. But now it's Tatum and Brown's fault.  They almost made the finals because they went up against a far inferior Cavs team. That Celtics team that made the ECF would have gotten destroyed by the Bucks all the same.  It isn’t Tatum and Brown’s “fault”. I’m just pointing out that they’re simply much better players this season compared to last. In addition, Hayward is having his best season since his all star year in Utah. You’re isolating the “Kyrie bad” narrative when in reality basketball is a team game that is affected by more than just one player. If you replace Kyrie with a PG who’s nearly as good, and every other player takes a step forward then no shit they’re going to be a better team.	0

MJ never won a single series as an underdog. he just wasn't a guy who made a bad team good, he made good teams great  look at the retirement period in the mid 90s, they won 55 without him then he came back with a month to go the next season and while they were upset, they went into the playoffs as the title favorites.

If we're just blindly inserting prime 1st peat MJ into the equation statistically, he wins any close series LeBron ever had:   LeBron choked in 2007, 2011, 2013, 2015. His average finals were 2012 and 2016, while best by far was 2014.   MJ loses 2017-2018. If we just insert MJ's stats for LeBron's he easily wins 2016 finals against an injured Warriors team. He might even win 2015 finals as well when you look at LeBron's inefficiency (47% TS) compared to 60%+ that MJ always had. The 2014 is a tossup. We all know 2013 was completely luck based and LeBron didn't play well at all until game 7 and average in game 4/6, so MJ gets this as well. 2012 MJ gets it. 2011 I would probably say yes. 2007 was a horrible finals by LeBron - 22  pts 42% TS - and they had 2 close games. So at the very least MJ takes that series to 6.   Again, all dumb hypothetical since MJ's stats would look quite different with the rules changing.	0

Reply to any point in my other comment here, I’ll post it again, Below. Why weren’t they good enough to get 2nd seed with just MJ and role players, to avoid the pistons? Was it that mj needed what pippen later provided? Who knows. Also  Rookie Scottie in the playoffs averaged 26 minutes in there 3-2 win in the first round. I never said Scottie was better as a rookie, than cj is now. More so I’m talking about team fit not individual talent. The bulls needed someone who could raise their overall defense to elite, given mjs dominance in volume on offense and defense. Pippen provided that bump at the time. CJ alone doesn’t raise the teams at both ends in the same way. With MJ, they didn’t need a lot pieces to compete, but they still needed pieces.	1

No the bigger problem there was Asians across the country came out in masses to justify Peter Liang's murder of an unarmed innocent Black Man, using the excuse that White Officers get away with it so Asian cops should to. That was very dehumanizing, and you never seen Black Americans do that kind of thing as a collective to any group. Asians here in the United States have a long rap sheet of Anti Black American culture and behavior as a collective. Yet Foundational Black Americans been their main supporters since mass immigration became a thing in the 1970s. Again if White People came out in masses to support a White cop murdering a innocent Black Man, we would called them White Supremacist/Neo Nazis, Lynch Mobs, you name it. So why is it OK for Asians to do that? Yet they cry about Racism when White Supremacist turn on them? Again, don't cry to us Foundational Black Americans. Fight your own battle. Stop running to us whenever White Supremacist starts attacking them. Because any other time the Asian community seem to as a collective be perfectly fine with White Supremacy when the victim is Black. Again hold your own pair.	0

A few thoughts while watching the game:  * The defensive intensity was off the charts * Brook Lopez is a beast patrolling the paint - the forays into the paint by Lowry/FVV were absolutely annhilated by him (and as a salty fan: past 3 seconds a lot of times!) * And god does Brook love shitting on the Raps from 3. Also when did Robin start hitting 3s?! * Wow were the starters ice cold. Everyone shat on Ibaka and Lowry in the post-game thread, but FVV was hot garbage too * Not sure why OG didn't play. He was the only starter hitting his shots, and he was holding his own against Giannis pretty damn well * When did Ilyasova stop getting playing time?? * Holy shit Bud does 239048230948240629752093852 subs a game. Is this some kind of strategy to make the game slower and get more rest? It was also one of the longest games I've been to this season. * Giannis had FVV on him multiple times and passed it out - it was kind of weird. * Boucher and RHJ and Matt Thomas brought it. TDii too (though he also started ice cold - 0/5) * Raptors need Bucks-killer Norm in * Middleton is so damn good * Eric Bledsoe looke WAY better than he did in the playoffs vs the Raptors * Marvin Williams was a solid addition * This [image best describes the Raptors yesterday](https://preview.redd.it/pramgghgr6j41.jpg?width=960&auto=webp&s=63402faa16a5a6b630c997ba27ceb76b7e1ca989)   Overall - Raps great D, meh offense (horrible by starters). Bucks fantastic interior D, solid O, and everyone played so unselfishly.  If FVV had hit that three pointer off the steal (which I hated because of how far he was AND how cold he was), that would have made things *crazy*.	1

Yao was also a superhuman created by the Chinese government. They bred the tallest woman in China (the Chinese   basketball captain) with one of the tallest men in China (dad was 6'7).  Essentially he was practicing basketball under watch of the government since he was 5. It's some Gattaca shit. They knew he was going to be tall so they basically had him do shooting drills for practice. He came out extremely well rounded as a result, but since humans aren't supposed to grow that tall, his bones couldn't take it. NBA scouts had definitely heard of Yao growing up though, I guarantee it  [Article](https://www.smh.com.au/sport/basketball/yao-ming-the-basketball-giant-made-in-china-by-order-of-the-state-20060119-gdmsz0.html)	0

To act like Roy wouldn't put up a fight is absolutely ridiculous. Roy embarassed the light heavyweight division so bad that he had to move up to heavyweight and then dominated the heavyweight champ at the time, who had beaten Evander Holyfield before that.  I think Tyson would've won with both in their primes, simply because you can't make up 40 pounds in the ring like that and Roy was a super middleweight originally for Christ's sake, but to act like he wouldn't be able to do anything is pure fantasy, Roy went years without losing ROUNDS.  In 2003, it's not even a debate, you clearly don't know or ignore how bad Tyson looked against Lennox Lewis and how awful he was at this point of his career compared to his former self, so awful that he got knocked out by Danny fucking Williams.	0

Ignore. Just ignore.      Resume the season immediately. NBA should never suspend/cancel the season. The league should never waste another year of prime LeBron.

If no team is going to wanna play, just give him MVP and just give the Lakers a title. They already beat Bucks & Clippers, so at this point NOBODY would have any doubt Lakers deserve the trophy anyways.	0

Yeah they did a great job there.   > I'm convinced half the Trump haters in the USA would be angry if he cured cancer for fucks sake. ""But... Why didn't he do it sooner?!? BLOOD ON HIS HANDS"".  I’m actually not a Trump hater. I don’t care for him but I would have voted him last election, and again this upcoming election if I was an American.

There's absolutely no way in hell Gobert should make the All-Star game this year.

Jackson would get fired in less than 2 seasons. Legendary coaches ride the backs of their Great players. Lebron wouldn't give jackson a chance to implement any type of system. Coaching doesn't get brought up because lebron had more than several chances to play for great coaches and he chose henchmen, that wouldn't ruffle his LeFeathers too much. He's a cancer when it comes to playing in a space and system where he is not ball dominant and stat padding. It would never work.	0

Westbrick is the most toxic team cancer on the court in NBA history, Ruined Melo's career, he was literally an all star the season before he became a thunder all of a sudden cancerbrick and his stans blamed him for all of OKC's failures.   Once oladipo got away from him he immediately became an all star and led his team to the same record as trash's team despite trash having a vastly superior team.  PG demanded a trade when he finally realized how badly he fucked up staying with the overrated trash.  KD left the thunder because of trashbrick and him liking (and later unliking) several tweets and posts on twitter/instagram bashing trash several different times is no coincidence, even his brother was bashing him as well.   There isnt a player that makes star teammates worse than trash and its not even close. How the fuck do you get outplayed by a rookie and lose to a rookie led team that didnt have a single all star in their entire roster in the first round especially when you have 2 HoFers on your team.  If that isnt enough proof to convince you hes a toxic team killing cancer, look at the thunder, immediately got much better the second they traded him, even has a record much better than trash's new team.   Trash is Lucky the season got suspended, harden was looking to be trash's next victim, and oh boy if they lost to okc in the 1st round, i mean trash's career is already buried with a tombstone, but that would be a cherry on top of his career's coffin.	0

"He's taking what the guy said in the top comment - ""ITT a bunch of people who have never hooped"" - and ratcheting it up to 11.  Nothing in his comment is even talking about fouling.  It's just laughably stereotypical blustering about how great he was in high school.  And that's the point.  He's mocking the original top comment by saying things like ""their's such a big disconnect between myself and your typical redditor"" - because that's what the original top commenter is essentially doing: creating a disconnect between himself and those ""ITT who have have never hooped""  It's a caricature of *that guy who peaked in high school and always brings up that one big game to try and impress people years later*.  That's also why he said ""only to get fucked over by the refs in the 4th""...it's a reference to the 'ole ""[Man if only coach had put me in we would have won the championship](https://aleteia.org/blogs/catholic-thinking/dont-be-uncle-rico-a-moral-snatched-from-napoleon-dynamite/)"":  >I’m dead serious…How much you wanna make a bet I can throw a football over them mountains?… Yeah… If Coach woulda put me in fourth quarter, we would’ve been state champions  No one is being given the nickname ""speedhawk"" lmao.  And when he says *why* his coaches called him that, it's because he had ""such a nose for basketball"", which has nothing to do with speed.    It's a satirical comment in the same vein as the ""Navy Seal 300 confirmed kills"" or ""To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand..."" copypastas.  Also it's literally just a /r/nfl [copypasta](https://old.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/e3ovc9/speedhawk/):  >Am I the only one in this sub who's actually played organized tackle football before?  >Like half of the comments I've seen on this sub are so obviously written by non-athletes that it's almost humorous.  >When I was in high school (3 year starter for our varsity football team) I would get a full-on sprint going and clock the shit outta whoever had the ball. My coaches called me ""speedhawk"" as a nickname caus I had such a nose for the football and for those three seasons I was considered the most feared safety in our conference. Senior year I led my team to the state semifinals only to get fucked over by the refs in the 4th but that's another conversation (DM me if you're interested in hearing about it)  >So, yeah.

I mean she had advocated for almost entirely the same policies as Bernie for the past ~15 years, while directly opposing many of Bidens policies so whether or not you think Bernie defines true progressivism it'd be pretty damn hard to argue she didn't go back against many of her longly held (or I guess stated is more accurate) beliefs. Policies her and Bernie both advocated for while Biden has not and will not include: legalizing weed, enacting a wealth tax, ending fracking, getting rid of superpacs/ large money donors influence in politics, getting rid of superdelegates, cover everyone on govt run health insurance and eliminate private insurance, consider a job guarantee, focus deportations only on criminals and security threats, make college free etc etc. She was loudly anti superpac but then cashed a 14.5 mil check from one silicon valley exec while claiming Bernie had superpacs (because a youth led climate action group and a nurses union chose to endorse him and gave him pennies compared to Liz's superpac, and are funded by small donations which are completely dif than being funded by a few extremely rich donors that you're then beholden too) and had been very anti super delegates going against the will of the people only until she knew she couldn't win a majority and decided she actually was okay with that if it meant her having a chance when her campaign was all but dead. And whether you think Bernie defines progressivism he was the only other progressive in the race and she willingly chose to attack him again and again, like when she all of a sudden got mad at him for something he supposedly said 8 months prior (while remaining on friendly terms with him in the interim) and loudly condemning Bernie again and again claiming he needs to be responsible for every anonymous Twitter account that says anything mean (which he did in fact denounce) while doing nothing to denounce her supporters saying heinous shit on there constantly as well. If random people tweeting snake emojis at you for you going back on things you've claimed to believe in for years is enough to not support the only candidate left in the race that had similar policiess, I think it's fair to say Warren doesn't actually give a shit about the things she's claimed to for all these years and it's pretty hard to make a case she's progessive after her actions had a huge contribution in stiffling any chance of a progessive movement making any real strides	0

They didn’t even have a chance to offer him an extension. He literally didn’t want to be there and signed with another team the first chance he got.  I’ve provided multiple facts.

I know being wrong is tough for some people.	0
"The very connotation of ""No homo"" is that being homo is something bad or to be ashamed of that you need to specifically say you're not that.   Imagine if someone said ""I like watermelon"" and then followed it up with ""No black person"". That'd be totally fucked up right? There's nothing wrong with liking watermelon and it's narrow minded to make a statement that specifically links it to a black person. In that same vein there's nothing wrong with admiring or praising another person of the same gender and it's narrow minded to make a statement that doing so is explicitly homosexual in nature.   No one's stopping you from saying ""jokes"" but don't be surprised when people assume you're an asshole for telling them.  Edit: If trying to be a little empathetic and more accepting is too much for your pride you do not need to respond to this trying to justify your immature behavior to me. I'm not trying to force beliefs on anyone, rather just educate and maybe help someone see why saying ""No homo"" is considered offensive. The world is already a mean enough place.  Edit 2: Thank you reddit for repeatedly stating that homosexuality and being black are not the same thing. No kidding! I never said they were, but both the homosexual community and the black community have faced discrimination for who they are which is why I tried to use the example I did to illustrate how both types of ""joking"" are wrong. Also, there are no thought police and no one is going to prevent you from being a hateful vulgar piece of shit. I apologize for having the audacity for wanting to help spread a little empathy and explain why something like ""no homo"" could come off as being hurtful and offensive to people."	1

"> They had the opportunity to offer him an extension after the season and before free agency. They didn't.  Yeah, and as it clearly states in black and white the reason they didn’t offer a formal extension was because they were aware it wouldn’t make sense for him financially. They didn’t offer the extension because they knew it made more sense to him money-wise to wait for a bigger contract in the summer. Literally right there in English, but I understand reading comprehension isn’t really your strong suit.  In terms of this summer’s free agency, they didn’t offer him a contract because they knew he didn’t want to be there. It isn’t because they didn’t *want* him back. They just understood he’d rather be elsewhere. Not really that difficult to understand.  > Again, you don't know what ""facts"" mean. At all.

Watch out you’re about to get downvote bombed by retarded nephews that only know how to say fuck d wade and 9.  It’s so funny how no one can show how this series was rigged they show no footage of fouls that were phantom calls. That one foul in game 5 people think was a phantom foul was actually a legit wrist slap and grab once you saw the other angle.   This is the one narrative where mob mentality just rules there’s no way to convince these mouth breathers that the Mavericks just couldn’t defend wade. And their own coach said the strategy was to foul instead of give free layups. Please watch the second link for the dom2k video before spewing some bs	0

Lol how can you come even close to pinpointing a recovery rate when a majority of the cases are going undiagnosed including mine? Those are a bunch of hypotheticals. We could fluke up and find a cure next week even thought that’s extremely unlikely. And I would hope the retirement homes and vectors would make a attempt to quarantine the employees and give them guides to follow. It seems to be like most people recover within a week so just give the employees frequent tests and if they test positive don’t let them return until they beat it. Probably who we should be testing rn instead of NBA players and other celebrities who feel fine. And I might be overestimating it but I still feel as if us as human beings went out of are way to check on them and assist them they’d make it through just fine and we could survive without a possible economic crash.	0

With the Pacers leading 97–82 and less than a minute left in the game, Pistons [center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(basketball)) [Ben Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Wallace) attempted a layup shot but was fouled hard from behind by Pacers SF Ron Artest, now known as [Metta World Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metta_World_Peace). A furious Wallace then shoved Artest, and the benches emptied; a fight broke out on the court between players of both teams. After the fight was broken up, a fan threw a drink from the stands at Artest while he was lying on the scorer's table to cool himself down. Artest immediately charged after the fan, sparking a massive brawl between players and spectators that stretched from the seats down to the court and lasted several minutes.

They won more games against the pistons in 89 than in 88. They took the pistons to 6 games in 89. Pippen had 9 steals and 8 blocks in that 6 game series. He shot 67% ts against the knicks as well. Although he did struggle offensively against the world championship pistons. No one took them past 6 that year at all. they swept the lakers in comparison.  Cj doesn’t provide the defensive versatility of Pippen, who even in his second year he was averaging 2 steals and a block a game. CJ knows that he has to show up on offense to be a positive on the outcome of the game. Pippen provided a lot to the bulls even in his rookie year. His size and court coverage were impressive. He averaged 1.2 steals and .7 blocks on just 20 minutes.    My argument is that MJ needed Pippen to get to the finals/wcf. So saying that Lillard is not clutch when he hasn’t been to the finals is somewhat ridiculous in my opinion. Even in his rookie season MJ was making game winners in clutch time. If his team was never good enough to get to the finals in hindsight, MJ would still be clutch as a person. Judging clutchness by finals appearance, is IMO the sign of being ignorant that titles are a team achievement, not a player achievement by and large. Like I would say Gilbert arenas was clutch, but he barely made the playoffs.	1

"I edited my comment to give you an example of what I'm trying to explain. I don't know if you read it before replying to I'm going to copy paste it here.  > Edit: Here's an example that I hope my resonate with you. The [swastika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika) is the go to symbol of white hate groups, but when used by Hindus and Buddhists it represents love and peace. Context changes the meaning of a symbol because almost all simple symbols have versatile uses.   > That said a symbol representing one concept does not invalidate it's representation of another concept. If a swastika is used in a town with no Hinduism or Buddhism to be found then it's pretty easy to tell they're bigots in the community.  > What you're saying is that because the ""OK"" symbol is used by people to say ""you're good to go"" it can't also mean ""white power"" when used in a certain context. Which just doesn't make sense with any bit of logic involved.  Keep in mind you moving the conversation to Hitler is avoiding the issue at hand with whataboutism and further goalpost moving but I'll try to use your example.  Hitler taking pictures with his dog is one guy. Sure he's a horribly bigot monster but he's still one person. One person doing something doesn't make it a trend.  Now lets say people in hate groups made an active effort to buy one kind of dog; lets say bulldog. They then constantly make efforts to take group pictures with their bulldogs, posting those pictures in connection to bigoted comments, mentioning their bulldogs during their sentencing for hate crimes, their clothing has patches of bulldogs on them, etc.  Well when that happens you have a clear indication that with regards to white nationalists the bulldog is a hate symbol.  This scenario doesn't mean that taking pictures with dogs is racist, or that having a bulldog is racist, it just means that if someone who you already expected possibly being a bigot is making an effort to bring up/show bulldogs then you have further reason to suspect them.   So lets say you have that politician who constantly supports programs that negatively impact minorities and he's always rocking a bulldog tie or pin. Well, then you would want to look into his history and see if it's just a coincidence or maybe he has a history of bigotry, possibly even a connection to a hate group that's gone under the radar  But in our world a large number of bigots have never appropriated dogs or pictures with them into being a symbol of white supremacy so this isn't true. Instead we have the fact they've clearly adopted the ""OK"" symbol to be used as a signal of white supremacy.   As such when being used by a bigot it's a hate symbol even if it wouldn't be when used by someone else. That's how context works."	1

So because you played this one guy in one on one that didn't post you up you don't think an NBA player would post up a smaller NBA player in a serious one on one game? Almost every time a smaller player is switched onto a bigger NBA player in a game there is a clear out and a post up. I don't even know how this is up for debate, it's just basic basketball knowledge. The easiest way to score on someone smaller than you is to post them up. If you played against someone that was 6'10 and he didn't post you up then I'm led to believe that either the game wasn't very serious or he knew he was just so much better than you that he didn't need utilize his size in the best way possible. In this game, Jeff Green couldn't afford to try to face up and break Steve Nash off the dribble	1

.....And talent they have .    I am shocked how many people are saying “they work just as hard as men , they shouldn’t get pid less” just shows you reddits understanding of economics and just generally how the world works.   An average boys Varsity basketball team would run them off the court and it wouldn’t even be close , I think this actually sets back women when you argue they should be getting paid based on gender and not merit .	1

Because the expectations of being an athlete are the same as being a desk jockey at KPMG's...   You can't say suck my dick, you're replaceable.  Hes a lottery pick and is a big part of their future plans, thus he has more value.   Youre projecting, become more valuable and you too can go on your own unprofessional tirades. Until then show up on time and work the extra hours to pay your dues, unpaid of course.	1

i personally think it’s idiotic to think that harden actually thinks giannis lacks any skill at all as a basketball player  i also think your inability to see that demonstrates your fundamental bias in this conversation  there is no point continuing if we fail to find common ground in the fact that harden clearly doesnt genuinely think giannis has no skill at all. god, it feels stupid to even type that  good night	1

Deflection. Yes the current administration failed the US, but it is CHINA that will rightfully be burdened and reprimanded for creating and spreading the Wuhan virus. This needs to be the event that galvanizes the world against the morally corrupt and oppressive dictatorship that is the CCP. These kinds of articles (while well intentioned from a Chinese American athlete) can not be some soothing balm to make us forget. The world needs to stay angry at the CCP and needs to inflict retribution on it.	0

">The truth is the majority of the French people adored Napoleon.  That's not true these days. The French are very split on their views of Napoleon, so much so that although they have multiple streets and monuments named after french legends/heroes/icons, none exist for Napoleon.  &#x200B;  To the right wing, Napoleon is a patriotic icon. To the left wing it's man that took advantage of the french population , although he did enact social reforms the fact that he sacrificed almost 600 thousand lives for his wars and brought back slavery, and his attacks on  any doubters/opposition  made him a tyrant.  &#x200B;  Hitler was also ""adored"" by his people... at first."	0
He's reddit's favorite player. I thought it was Dirk until the last couple days. It's not just about Duncan vs Kobe anymore. Now people are downvoting anyone who even mildly disagrees that Duncan isn't top five, which is widely the consensus opinion. Idk how you have him above three of MJ, LeBron, Wilt, Kareem, Bird, Shaq, or Magic. I'm ready for the downvotes just for pointing that out without having even criticized Duncan at all. But then everyone will complain about Bronsexuals	0

I'm not entirely sure why you did that racial breakdown, but okay, yep, those are accurate numbers.  The margin of error I'm referring to is about the true mean of the population, not the one individual data point in 2019. Due to the small difference in this number (4%), and the fact that the lead has shifted since as recent as 2014 and the parity at around 2016-2017, AND the fact that in a different poll I found Hispanics were actually 1% higher than whites in gay marriage acceptance (in my other comment), it's not really possible to say whether Hispanics or whites  are more accepting of gay marriage.   Your other concerns are speculation that would need to be borne out by actual evidence. Pew is a reasonably reputable source and I'm not willing to grant you this point. I can easily conceive that white people would be LESS likely to say that they were against gay marriage than Hispanic people on a poll, so the survey may actually overestimate support on whites for any variety of reasons. You have decent logic about people not willing to say they are against gay marriage, but why would Hispanic people be less willing to say that? You can come up with any reason you want but it's going to be even more speculative and untethered by evidence.  Your last problem is indicative of the problem in your modality of thinking. You've already presupposed that people of color are more homophobic, and because the evidence shows that this is not true for AAPI or Hispanics, you question the data. Would you be questioning the data if it showed like 40% numbers for Hispanics and AAPI? If you're being honest with yourself, I would guess not (but I'm not going to say for certain as that's presumptuous).	1
