> not being gay is homophobia  K	1
"Names themselves are never racist, sexist, etc. in isolation. The word ""faggot"" itself is not homophobic, and ""bitch"" is not misogynistic. It's how those words have transformed over time to demonize specific groups of people that make them bad. In other words, context matters.  The context here is that people are being attacked because people inexplicably falsely equivocate ""Chinese Virus"" to mean people of Chinese descent have it and carry into their neighborhoods.   I guarantee you if MERS were ravaging America right now we would also see a movement to refer to it by its scientific name EMC-2012 as well and instead of Asians, it would be Middle Easterns being vilified (again, or still). And I would be all for it instead of defending xenophobic rhetoric on reddit because it literally wouldn't hurt me to do so and maybe save a life or two in the process.  You have actual redditors in this very thread talking about how their lives are being affected by this type of rhetoric that emboldens racists. Posts like yours that deflect and miss the forest for the trees doesn't make things any better.  > not a reason to call somebody a racist  The past 3.5 years aside, the POTUS speaks on behalf of all Americans, does he not? If there is rhetoric that instigates violence against Americans, should he use it? Just because the word itself is just a synonym doesn't make it okay."	0
I agree. Him calling it a hoax was very retarded. Him calling it the Chinese virus technically isn’t wrong	0

Isaac Okoro, though a lot of ppl have started to catch on. First and foremost he’s a winner (tough, competitive, fills multiple roles), great defender, underrated passer, plays to his strengths and rarely makes mistakes. Even if he doesn’t end up being a star he’s gonna be a plus role player even if he’s just putting up mediocre numbers. He’d be the bench player that plays 25mpg and ends up closing games for you  Jalen Smith, lean and mobile 6’10  3 and D big that can also rebound. Really fits today’s game. Honestly don’t know why he’s so low, might be because this is his second year? Don’t see what’s wrong with him besides maybe lacking star upside.  Amar Sylla, basically an ahead of schedule Pascal Siakam. Plays for Real Madrid too so you know he’s learning the game the right way. Has to clean up his skill level and put on good weight, but I think his versatility is really gonna help get him on the floor	0

Lmao the Lakers did sure but I didnt see him fitting in very well if you had actually watched a knicks game you’d see he ISO’s and posts up in the high elbow looking for a midrange shot. He’s a subpar defender and basically just slightly better kuzma. In our system as the third option  I doubt he would be better than he was in Boston. But yeah trading him for kuz and one of the best 3 and D players in the league is definitely a good idea 😂	1

No thats nowhere near a realistic portrayal of the situation. This virus kills the old and already sick, for the absolute majority it will be similar to a flu. Mass unemployment and a deep depression is much more dangerous. And your second point is just ridiculous. Tens of millions are living in poverty, and they are barely covered by benefits. Imagine if 50 million more people become unemployed and now will rely on the government for food and housing. Thats the real societal collapse, not a flu that kills the old and frail mostly. Sure the virus will cause many people to need to stay home just like during a regular flu, but after 1-2 weeks those people will have recovered and hopefully have immunity.  You and everyone else here are doing exactly what that guy warned against, which is to buy into the panic and act in stupid emotional ways. The only solution is the vaccine, and no country can stay locked down for more than 3 months.	1

From what I understand, Lebron went to Miami to gain championship experience and he wanted a change from the shitty front office of the Cavs. He went back purely for his promise to win a championship for his home team, so I think he still would have returned regardless of which team he chose in 2010	0

"[https://www.np.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/ezytd9/reasons\_that\_john\_paxson\_gar\_forman\_need\_to\_go/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/ezytd9/reasons_that_john_paxson_gar_forman_need_to_go/)  So without further ado, here are my reasons Garpax need to go:  In no particular order  * Cristiano Felicio Contract. He was 25 years old averaging 4 and 4. * Waiving Spencer Dinwiddie in favor of Michael Carter-Williams * Trading Tony Snell for Michael Carter-Williams * Letting Spencer Dinwiddie walk in favor of MCW * John Paxson choking Vinny Del Negro (His own hire), he would later be quoted ""What also disappointed me was that VDN never owned up to making a mistake"" * Fired Scott Skiles on Christmas Eve * Fired Bill Cartwright days after Thanksgiving after giving him mismatched rosters and under-preforming * Overruling This lobbying for Draymond Green to draft Marquis Teague * Refused or failed to take back salary and gather assets preferring to bet on player Development in Jabari Parker & Otto Porter JR * Tyrus Tomas for LaMarcus Aldridge * The biggest free agent signing of their tenure they almost immediately started drama with telling him he was no longer allowed to wear a headband. This policy would appear to be reverted years later w/ no explanation * Interviewed no one for the job of Head Coach but Jim Boylen & hired him. Worse several reporters (For example Vinny Goodwill) have alleged that this was like to have been planned since the summer beforehand. * Blindsided Hoiberg by firing him after showing up expecting to run practice. During his tenure here they fed him a steady stream of their personal projects & mandated them to receive playing time. None of these projects worked out. Examples are Jerian Grant, Cameron Payne, Joffrey Lavergne, Zipser, Felicio, etc. * Leaked that Derrick Rose was healthy to the media putting a ton of pressure on him to return in time for the playoffs & launching a wave of jokes that never really let up * Let Ron Adams go from Thibs Staff angering him & resulting in him going on to be the architect of the Warriors championship defense. He now has 3 rings. * Not trading Pau Gasol in 2015-16 where we would miss the playoffs and he would walk for nothing * Ran such a sloppy situation around Thibs firing that word reached Thibodeau Hoiberg would be his likely replacement while he was still coaching the team. Also serious speculation that this was told to players, undermining his authority as coach. * Thibs even being hired is a win for them right? No, they actually didn't want him. Tom Thibodeau was the recommendation of an outside group hired by Reinsdorf. John Paxson wanted Doug Collins and Gar Forman wanted Mike Brown. * Refused to hire Thibs strength & conditioning coach (Anthony Falsone) in Houston. He would later be hired and win the championship with the San Antonio Spurs in 2013-14. He still serves as their athletic director today. * Escorted Thibs out with security when he was fired. * Overpaid Fred Hoiberg 5 years /25 million and then fired him before it was complete. K.C. Johnson has speculated this is the reason why Jim Boylen remains. As, they don’t want to be paying two coaches not coaching at the same time. * Letting a lot of talent walk for nothing. To avoid the headache of having to defend each and every player in this group I’ll make my case for the best and attach the rest as honorable mentions. Omer Asik is the biggest mistake. We had no backup 5 to replace him and Houston ended up getting an almost lottery pick for him later on so he was definitely moveable if we ever wanted out. Honorable mentions: Deng, Marco, E’Twaun, the Bench mob. * Amnestied Carlos Boozer way too late to be able to matter * Leaked that Kris Dunn apparently wasn’t working hard enough over the summer * Failed to see the writing on the wall and instead of rebuilding committed us to that meaningless three alphas year just to do the same thing in the end. * The entire Doug McDermott situation can be made into like eight bullets and is stupidly controversial among Bulls fans. But I know there will be stans in the comments so I will let them defend Garpax. * Trading 17 & 18 for 11 in the 2013 draft  \*Using #11 to draft Doug Mcderrmott in a good draft.  * Dumping Doug Mcderrmott just two years later for basically nothing. * Were incredibly late to the game of analytics, frequently downplaying its importance. * Kevin O’ Connor speculates that their promising to draft Chandler Hutchison restricted us from doing any draft night trades involving the #22 pick in 2018. Started our rebuild by selling a second- round pick. (We know Jordan Bell isn’t good, that’s never what this was about) * Third largest market in the NBA, paid the luxury tax twice. Traded for OPJ whose making 27 million and has played in 24/78 games available. If his girlfriend is reliable he’s also not a fan of the front office and a free agent in a year. * Horrible medical team. We’re always injured every single year. * Rosters frequently have big holes and they take bizarre steps to fix them. No Small Forward? Jabari. Need a long-term scoring option next to Rose? 33-year-old Rip Hamilton seems like a safe bet. (I love Rip but that doesn’t make it a good signing) Need a solid starting ball-handler & playmaker? Tomas Satorasnky, MCW, Jerian, Rondo seems like the wait maybe nvm. I know that you can’t nail every signing and not even all of these are bad. It’s more that there seems to be consistent gaps between how they evaluate talent & fit and that actually translates to the court. * 5 Playoff Series wins total in a 17-year tenure. * Had a Bulls doctor question Luol Deng about sitting out of games for a broken leg. * Dumped John Salmons and a first & second round pick to chase Lebron and ended up with nothing. * Trading Kirk Hinrich during his farewell tour for basically nothing. * Again, overruling Thibs when he liked Rudy Gobert for Tony Snell * Pulled the QO on David Nwaba for Jabari Parker. I feel like Nwaba while maybe not fantastic on his own fit really well with us. We’ve been a worse team since he left. * Misused Lauri basically his entire time here. Maybe not directly because of this but it’s now being rumored that he wants out. * Traded Taj Gibson in a year we made the playoffs for Cameron Payne & Joffrey Lavergne. * Failing to net any assets at the 2020 trade deadline. * IMO have had serious questions regarding their drafting ability since now Orlando Magic assistant GM left in 2012. * Are alleged to use the media to trash players and coaches by [Van Gundy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I4Y4VyDqrs)  ETA: - Dwade contract  * Couldn't build around Jimmy * Bad player development, everyone is regressing save Zach * Had coaches spy on coaches/players (Randy Brown) * Failed to make Chicago a FA destination * Inherited the prestige Jordan gave us, made us a joke. * Threatening to give Jimmy Butlers minutes to Tony Snell when he refused a contract extension."	0

Doubt you will look into this, you'll probably just keep your head in the sand. 2009, 4g roll out. Swine Flu outbreak. 3g rolled out in 2001 - SARS outbreak 2002. Radio towers massively rolled out. Radio towers massively rolled out in 1910 - Spanish Flu outbreak in 1912.   5G rolled out....first in Wuhan China. 2nd in Spain. Third in Italy. Then the US (major port cities..NY, LA, Seattle).   Do you see a pattern? It may be nothing, but it is absolutely a pattern worth looking at.  The WHO seems radio frequency radiation as carcinogenic.  5G is used in WEAPON SYSTEMS for crowd control. 5G Network Uses Same EMF Waves As Pentagon Crowd Control System. ...

I have a funny story about Boston: little over a decade ago I moved to NYC and had a friend living in South Boston. I was waiting on a job so I went up there to stay for a bit. We were getting around on bikes and I was riding my friends girlfriends bike as I didn’t have one. It was this pink mountain bike looking thing. Well as we’re riding down the street I hear a loud noise hit my spokes, a decent size stick. I turn around shocked to see a what looked like a 12 year old? Say “nice Bike Fag*ot”. I start laughing because it was a pretty wild scene. He follows it up with a “wetback”.   Im not implying anything about Boston fans. In fact I have a gay cousin raising adopted kids with his partner there too who are big fans. Will just never forget that story.	1

That backpedal by Allen still remains the craziest thing I've seen in an NBA game.  That's a motherfucker that practiced that 10,000 times in his life.

Harden is a waaaaaaaaaay better offensive player, DWade had moves but he was a very limited shooter, got the line, but had a bad FT shooting for a guard.   Harden is also very underrated defensively. Nevertheless, Wade is better defensively overall and on his prime he was DPOY-level in 08/09 after Beijing, but the most important thing is that he is much more consistent overall.   So until consistency matters it’s even, when it matters throughout tough playoff series when you can’t fall below your level on every single night, it’s advantage to DWade which is crucial.	0

Time to ban large gatherings.  This is NOT your seasonal flu. 20% of those that get COVID-19 require hospitalization and 15% require supplementary oxygen.     The transmission rate is also significantly higher at 3 to 7 for every one person infected. Flu is super small compared to that.  Only reason numbers are not bigger is because states has NOT been testing like other countries. Only 500 tests done vs 30000 in South Korea and 20000 in Italy.  Can't find infected without tests.  And young people with no underlying conditions have died, death rate is 2%.  Not to mention you do not know long term effects, given its been shown to attack kidneys and other organs.  And if you have hospitals overwhelmed and over capacity there is no where to get help for any illness!!!	1

"Not even the point. We have seen three different explanations post festum... And then they zeroed it in on one, ""official and according to the rules"". And lmao, holy shit, its you again! 🍻 I wasn't clear enough... The rules say the whistle decides when game goes on and when it doesn't. This wasn't a continuation of the inadverted whistle, it was a change of possession after the inadvertent whistle. This ""shooting motion"" is an excuse that was used before - with different official explanations each time. How can you call a ""continuation play"" after player A goes for a layup, player B blocks the shot, ref whistles(incorrectly = makes a mistake), player C catches the ball and scores a put back... They ""inadvertently"" called a nonexistent basket - and finish the review saying that call was wrong, BUT the basket, that wasn't called during the action, gets confirmed 5 minutes after it was supposedly made - in a shooting motion already? Mavs lost 2 games on the same ""inadvertent call"" BS - buy 2 completely opposite official rullings on an unclear, flawed rule."	1

Isaiah Stewart I love, think he’s the type to have a 15 year career. High energy, does the little things, throws his body around (and others’) but plays with a great feel and has some decent skill. I’m surprised he’s fallen so low on mocks these days, you’d think his biggest worry is that he’s too short to play the 5 but the league is downsizing these days.  McDaniels tho I’m not a fan of and I usually love the tall skinny wings. I just don’t think he plays smart basketball at all, and it negates what skill he does he have. To play the type of way he perceives himself, he either has to get a lot more skilled or a lot smarter and I don’t think either happens. He can be a more than solid stretch 4 but it’ll take some self-reflection or else he’ll just bounce around a bunch of teams on the bench	0

I cannot think or comprehend of anything more cucked than having a daughter. Honestly, think about it rationally. You are feeding, clothing, raising and rearing a girl for at least 18 years solely so she can go and get ravaged by another man. All the hard work you put into your beautiful little girl - reading her stories at bedtime, making her go to sports practice, making sure she had a healthy diet, educating her, playing with her. All of it has one simple result: her body is more enjoyable for other men. Raised the perfect girl? Great. Who benefits? If you're lucky, a random man who had nothing to do with the way she grew up, who marries her. He gets to ravage her every night. He gets the benefits of her kind and sweet personality that came from the way you raised her. As a man who has a daughter, you are LITERALLY dedicating at least 20 years of your life simply to raise a girl for another man to enjoy. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck. Think about it logically.	0

To the left wing it's man that took advantage of the french population , although he did enact social reforms the fact that he sacrificed almost 600 thousand lives for his wars and brought back slavery, and his attacks on  any doubters/opposition  made him a tyrant.  &#x200B;  Hitler was also ""adored"" by his people... at first."	0

I would pick Curry if there is another more than average player. Because Curry can't contest the targeted defense since I think 2018. Also I would pick Curry if there are enough great defenders.

I was criticizing a moron who wants to think about when and where basketball needs to be played down the road can the eye of a pandemic that's killing our countrymen putting nurses and doctors at extreme risk with honestly no end in sight at this point. Over three million people have applied for unemployment.  People are out of work losing their jobs & don't know when  or how they're going to be able to support their families again. It's not a priority. And that's what Baron Davis was calling him out for. You want to watch basketball go on YouTube and watch all the classic games subscribe to ESPN Plus if you need your fix so bad. Either now or whenever the f*** it's appropriate to start playing basketball or thinking about that. Now is not the time to be talking about the future of basketball when our present situation is this critical and swiftly approaching FUBAR. FUCK YOU.	0

"ok retard, let me educate you, i pay about 40% (would be less, but im in the highest tax bracket) of my income that includes taxes and MANDATORY social and health insurance which means universities and healthcare is ""free""...so effectively im taxed 40% because i dont have a choice of not paying,its just called 25% tax on income and the rest is divided between social and health insurance - but its all effectively tax, and thats fine i think its a fair system that i also benefit from  i dont know who told you that most have private insurance, probably your retard friends who know as much as you do, so let me explain again its not private insurance, that would imply you have a choice of not being insured - what we have is a MANDATORY insurance governed by private insurance companies  so yeah taxes have a lot to do with healthcare  enjoy trump for another 4 years lmao"	0

At the end of the day. This is a Chinese virus that originated in China. Calling it Covid 19 or corona virus or whatever won’t actually stop the racism against Asians. It’s a very simplistic way to look at things, almost how a child would look at it to think otherwise. We could literally call this virus “birthday cake” and wherever it originated from, people would be ostracized from that area. It’s not just white People doing this. It’s every culture. It’s how humanity survived thousands of years of evolution. Whenever there is a threat to the populous we always take a negative view against the threat and where it comes from. It’s basic fucking psycholog honestly. But hey you want to virtue signal how morally fucking superior you think you are be my guest. Just don’t piss in my face and tell me it’s raining	0

" I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.  Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called ""Linux"", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.  There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called ""Linux"" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux."	0

If you raise minimum wage, you raise the wages of all other workers currently making more than minimum wage, and it doesn nothing but harm people. This money isn't coming out of thin air, and it isn't coming out of businesses pockets, either. They will raise prices to compensate. Every single time.   Minimum wage is literally a scam that hurts everyone EXCEPT people who are unwilling to improve themselves and politicians who get in votes based off of those policies.   Fuck the minimum wage. Fuck it so hard.  Literally creates unemployment.  Edit: Everyone thinks that raising the minimum wage takes money out of the pockets of evil billionaires. Go look at the average Amazon hourly wage for a warehouse worker. Seriously. Look that shit up.   You are DESTROYING small businesses. Especially ones that operate on thin margins, like the restaurant industry.  Y'all need to educate yourself on this. It's a necessity. We have got to stop voting for minimum wage increases.

The minimum salary is $582,000.

If you’re broke after making that much since October and are living paycheck to paycheck then you’re absolutely retarded  The minimum salary is $893,310 not $582,000 so my math is wrong.

Hes got a bit of a point. For a player that is considered top 5 by so many people, AD is a horrible leader and #1 option.  And why does being able to carry teams and be a leader even matter that much for top 10 rankings. Like sure john wall or other stars in 2016 might be able to lead teams to the playoffs but the goal is to win a championship and Draymond was much better at that.	0

This is pretty much just pandering (the only thing DeBlasio knows how to do). Critically ill patients don't need testing either. Having the test result does nothing to alter the treatment for those people. They are treated exactly the same whether they are confirmed to have COVID-19 or not.  Its actually better to use the tests on healthy asymptomatic people you think might have been exposed because you can use the knowledge from the test to quarantine people who aren't showing symptoms.  So Bill, shut the fuck up and go back to being a useless piece of shit and let the grownups work.	0

"Girlfriend sent this to me yesterday lol   > 🤔🤔😯 SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME THIS ISNT SO!!  ( I copied and pasted this blurb ).... This morning, at 4:30AM, our Prime Minister was served a criminal indictment by the US for corporate & financial crimes. Media owners were instructed to historically brainwash everyone that PM has Corona Virus with his wife and that they wont be leaving their house for a while.  >Tom Hanks was arrested 48hrs ago for Pedophilia and he is currently being kept in a Hotel room in Australia refusing to fly back to USA. Next celebrity arrests will be Celion Dion, Madonna, Charley Barkley, Kevin Spacey - all will claim Corona virus infections.  >Italy's airports have been completely shut down as over 80 of Vatican and financial officials have been served same criminal indictments for financial crime, pedophilia, child trafficking and sex abuse.  >United Emirates have completed mass arrests of their own Royal Family & affiliates.  >Convicted Hollywood rapist Harvey Weinstein agreed to a deal in exchange for his testimony against hundreds of top Hollywood celebrities and their involvement in the drug business, pedophilia and child trafficking. Instead of 55 year sentence, he only received 23y sentence. In exchange, he provided testimonies against some of the biggest & most powerful names including Prince Andrew of UK, former president Bill Clinton, former vice president Joe Biden, Tom Hanks, Oprah, Ellen DeGenerous, Quentin Tarantino, Charlie Sheen, Bob Saget, Kevin Spacey, John Travolta, Steven Spielberg, Podesta, NXIVM and PIZZAGATE sex trafficking clubs, and hundreds of more who all were directly involved with Jeffrey Epstein. In exchange of Jeffrey Epstein's testimony, he was allowed to make a deal and have his suicide in prison faked.  >CEOs of some major world corporations have been indicted/arrested and some forced to resign all in the last 30-60 days, such as CEO of NBA, Harley Davidson, Gates Foundation, Intel, McDonald's, Cesar Awards, Vatican Chief of Police, Disney..etc Approximately 700-800 more resignations are coming in the next 3 months.  >Lab-created Corona Virus is a cover up for mass mandatory vaccination agenda, as well a covert US Intelligence operation that the world has ever seen and this mass 158,000 arrest operation will remove & capture the biggest evil & corrupted politicians, celebrities and CEOs including global elites and bankers such as George Soros, UN officials, founders of GRETA INC.  >Trump will win 2020 elections and arrests of former US presidents will occur in early 2021. All major arrests will be covered by media as an accident or conspiracy theory. All arrested individuals will be given ""Rommel Death"" meaning choice between suicide/accidental death in return for assurances that his/her reputation will remain intact, or face criminal trial that would result in public disgrace.  >Some top religious leaders will be arrested or forced to resign, some will get ""Sick"" suddenly. Vatican will be the first and the Pope will be removed in 2020. Production of human extracted Adrenochrome will be revealed and Hollywood and Vatican will be directly responsible for it.  >Coming up there will be a 2 month complete shut down of the worlds most common operations such as schools, stock exchange, some Banks, airports, shipping, travel, events, galas, expos, sport games, sport championships, music award ceremonies, NBA/NHL/Baseball games, ship cruises including food shortage and staged electricity power loss. Gas prices will go down, food costs will go up, insurance will go up, Gold/silver stocks will fall, many corporations will either bankrupt or take a significant financial loss such as whats about to happen to Air Canada, Disney and Coca Cola. H5N1 bird flu will be intentionally released this week out of China.  >Welcome to the greater awakening.

Similar to how after Trump so many people got the courage to show their true hateful selves.  Another issue would be, who is actually being surveyed?

Old guy reporting in--  During most of his career, Malone's off-court life was reported far less than it would be in this age of social media. And in the 80s and 90s he was given much more cover than he would get today. Those of us who cared about statutory rape were in the minority.  That said, although he was a phenomenal NBA star, his on-court behavior was reprehensible enough to make him one of the most hated players in the game without bringing in his scandalous personal life. Just ask David Robinson or Isiah Thomas about Malone's flying elbows. The Postman was perhaps the most dangerous and cold-blooded player in the history of the league. Right up there with Laimbeer.	0

"I'll get back to you on that.   I wouldn't call it a full-on admission, but that statement was definitely wonky as hell; ""I didn't rape her, but also, she's not lying when she says that I did"". It sounds like whoever wrote it was trying to come off as sympathetic instead of the standard deny-deny-deny, but it does leave a bad taste in my mouth.   Though, so does the fact that she refused to testify and dropped the criminal case in favor of a civil suit. It's a toss up until I reread some of the transcripts so I can cite actual info. I recall not believing her but I like to believe that my views are constantly being broadened, so idk yet"	0

Wade no doubt. This isn’t even a question.

His playoff efficiency ALWAYS drastically dipped compared to the regular season and he always had his worse series in the biggest games and moments   KD **WISHES** he could have have the run Dwade had in 2006   Put Dwade on those warriors teams instead of KD and they would have gone 16-0, 16-1 in both of their playoff runs  Put Trevor Ariza on those teams instead of KD and they still win at least 1 title lol that’s how stacked KDs team was   If this was asked in 2016 it would be overwhelmingly wade. It’s sad that so many retarded people got duped by KD on golden state thinking he could perform like that in the playoffs on any other team.

Reddit being openly racist to Asians is nothing new. I've dealt with this shit since I was a little kid.

That first half season he came back there was a lot of anxiety to see the ""real"" Jordan. The championships won during that in between time were fake. They weren't earned from Jordan. They were like kids acting up when the substitute came in.  When he finally traded the 45 in. That was for real. However crafted that was, I dunno. But I bought that Hook line and sinker.  With the COVID deal, thinking about watching the finals again. But think I'll start with the Pistons beating the Bulls that year prior.

Tough because they are probably the 2 best Centers in the NBA. Both players can't seem to stay in shape and look winded towards the end of the game. Embiid is hands down a better defender and scorer. Jokic is a better playmaker and is more durable when it comes to injuries. It's tough but if I had to pick, I say Embiid because when fully healthy, he's Hakeem 2.0. His raw skills to dominate the position on both the offensive and defensive is unstoppable.	0

I guess when I say “I go back and forth”, it’s in the context of “literally none of this should happen but since it’s reality and it is happening, maybe it’s a necessary evil within that construct”.	1

This is ridiculous.   Kevin Garnett would talk about your wife, parents getting cancer, people dying.   Kobe Bryant called a ref a fag on national television, cheated on his wife and settled a sexual assault case. He made it up to her with a an 8 million dollar diamond ring.  There are other players that literally tried to kill their coach (Sprewell) that don't get as much shit as D Wade does. Dude has some bad on-court moments but what he has done for representation of fathers, black fathers, gay, trans, and all he has done for Chicago, Miami, and some specific people should far outweigh that.	0

You're 100% right on the point of there being a big gap between the LGB and the T lol, it's something that gets discussed a lot within the lgbt community as well. In the loosest possible sense, transitioning simply means undergoing changes to better accommodate your gender identity rather than the identity you were assigned at birth - whether this takes the form of something as simple as a different name and pronouns or something as complicated as sex reassignment surgery and HRT.   Your original comment was fine, if i'm honest i took more of an issue with your second reply, which came across a bit more victim complex-y. The majority of the time if lgbt people say that you've done or said something bigoted towards lgbt individuals or the community, they probably aren't just saying it for fun. Now I can clearly tell you're pretty open minded and reasonable given that you're engaging in this discussion in good faith, so just listening to why they say that or accepting that you might have done something offensive and trying to change for the next time is the best way to deal with that situation. Sometimes it's as simple as just 'we live this, we know about our circumstances better, so please don't speak over us on the topic' you know?	1
I don’t see how you can hate gay people outside of a fear. Like, you are afraid it will destroy society, or that gay people existing will make your kids gay, or, most commonly, that men make you feel a certain way and the idea of gay people makes you afraid that you are gay yourself. I think it is a perfect word. Never met anyone that hated gay people that I would describe as anything other than afraid of the gay community.	1

What you guys don't understand is how broke Tillman Fertitta is right now.  Calling him a billionaire is misleading because he's as liquid as tile.  In fact, he's positioned about as poorly as you could be.  All of his primary revenue streams are literally shut down: restaurant, casino, hospitality, basketball.  He's highly leveraged.  He took out high interest loans against his hospitality businesses so he could buy the Rockets.  Les Alexander (former Rockets owner) also personally loaned him $175m to complete the Rockets sale.  And don't forget that he lost a huge Chinese revenue stream right before the season started.  Also, just to add insult to injury, the Thunder were actually better than the Rockets after the Russell Westbrook trade which is a reminder that the Rockets are on the books for mega max deals to Westbrook and Harden.  Tillman strikes me as the kind of guy to not pay in a circumstance like this anyway (if you've seen a few episodes of Billion Dollar Buyer, you get a feel for him) but he probably doesn't have the money to cough up as is.  Think about it - 1) if he's taking out high interest bonds on his primary companies that means his credit wasn't that good to begin with and he was illiquid and 2) he took out a $175m personal loan to complete the sale which means he didn't have that cash lying around.  Tilman is highly leveraged, all of his primary revenue streams have gone to 0 and will stay there for the next 2-3 months, all of his companies have taken a huge haircut in valuation (meaning he sells any right now and probably loses 20% off the top) and he has no cash on hand.  This man is positioned incredibly badly.  Like you'd almost have to try to be in a worse position.	0

When I was 13, I knew this girl who was my age. Looking back now, I realize this girl was a little hoe. Hell, this girl asked me(we were both 13), if I ever got a BJ. She told me she liked me, a few days later, she tells another boy she likes him. Fast foward a few months, this girl gets pregnant by a 20 year old. Looking back now, I dont blame the 20 year old because I know he didnt rape her. She was a crazy little slut. I blame the little hoe and the little hoes mother.  Everyone always gets so outraged but truth is, you dont know the facts. You don't know if this girl lied about her age and said she was 16 or 17. You can't say Karl raped her because you werent there, and he was never even charged with rape.   He was 20 years old at the time. its a 7 year difference...   The other day on /r/relationship_advice I saw some early 20s girl post something about marrying and having a kid with a like a 40 year old. It was like a 19 year difference and no one bats an eye.	0

The answer is no, a 23-yr old, 3rd year Ceballos was not going to tilt the series vs the eventual three-peat Bulls.  While Ceballos would blossom into a go-to player for the Lakers, and was on a solid run of 18-8 prior to getting hurt, he was not yet that All-star in Phoenix, similar to McGrady in Toronto or Harden in Oklahoma. Simply transposing later success onto an earlier rendition is asinine as Ceballos was not a made man, and had yet to break out. By all accounts Dumas was every bit the starting SF, putting up nearly 16ppg, 4.3 Reb 1.3stl 1.0blk per game, sandwiching a couple of 17pt games with a monster 20pt 12reb 5ast 2stl 3blk gm-1, and 25-5 in gm-5. Point is, he eclipsed whatever perceived production you think Ceballos would have given the Suns. Jordan still put up 41ppg for the single greatest finals output in history, Charles still struggled in games 1, 3, 5 and 6 and the Bulls still showed why being the defending Champs matters.	0
Well, I wouldn't label it as a phobia, because it's not like people are becoming scared or angry about homosexuality. But it just turns homosexuality into a joke. Not sure what the better word is.	1

>  Jeff Green  Jeff Green was getting around $15 million from Orlando in 16-17. The fact that the cavs didnt retool their roster once KD moved (which inevitably would mean trading Love for multiple defensive players) guaranteed defeat.

I don’t know if finding blogs about preseason/playoff predictions really tells us the 2010 Celtics and 2009 Magic were better than the 92 Blazers, 93 Suns, 96 Sonics, 97-98 Jazz. Especially when bloggers weren’t really around during the 90s.   I only know how great those teams were because broadcasters talked about them during the 96-98 Jordan run, my time on basketball forums on insidehoos, realgm, etc (2009-2013).   Anyway, here are some “blogs” about teams that never won a championship. The Dwight Magic aren’t on any of the lists, neither were the 2010 Celtics. Though the C’s won in 08, one of the articles won’t list them as it was more about multi-year squads.   https://www.sportscasting.com/great-nba-teams-didnt-win-championship/  https://www.chatsports.com/nba/a/Throwback-Thursday-The-10-Best-NBA-Teams-Never-to-Win-a-Championship-17635#/  https://www.realclearhistory.com/articles/2018/05/31/10_best_nba_teams_that_didnt_win_a_title_317.html  https://www.basketballnetwork.net/the-6-best-nba-teams-that-didnt-win-a-championship/  https://www.complex.com/sports/2013/06/the-best-nba-teams-to-never-win-an-nba-title/	0

I’d pick Barkley (tho probs not gonna a be around) over Shaq to breakdown games, be funny, and keep it all the way real.

Dude if you clapped and were talking trash I’d just take care of you on the court.  I can defend. And if it comes down to it, i played college football in the SEC.

Dude as a warriors fan, if u removed curry from that series, they don't win one game. How come warriors lost games 2 and 3 in which curry struggled. Even iggy knows he didnt deserve that FMVP over curry. Curry carried double teams all through that series and averaged 26 ppg. Iggy never shot a contested shot all series long and averaged 16ppg.. If Cavs never double teamed curry, he would average like 35ppg and iggy won't average more than 10ppg. Why didn't Ben Wallace win FMVP when pistons won if FMVP is based on playing defense..Tell me they wouldn't have given it to curry if he was a Nike athlete.	0

"Yeah fuck you too. The Yankees and Dodgers are in big markets (NY/LA) and are media darlings. You're only hearing about the Astros now cuz they beat  the Dodgers in the 2017 world series and the Yankees 2 of last 3 years in the ALCS including this year. So it's no coincidence the intial story from the Athletic just popped up out of nowhere during the World Series this year. Here ya go.  Here is the initial report from 2017 about the investigation:  >I have nonetheless concluded that during the 2017 season the Boston Red Sox violated the Regulation quoted above by sending electronic communications from their video replay room to an athletic trainer in the dugout.   https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-rules-on-red-sox-yankees-sign-stealing-and-fines-both-teams/   Here is a recent article highlighting something that wasn't admitted in 2017:  >""Martino noted the Yankees did use their video room from 2015 to 2017 to decode signs, and MLB warned them and the Red Sox during the 2017 season that ""future violations of this type will be subject to more serious sanctions, including the possible loss of draft picks.""  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2871537-report-mlb-not-investigating-yankees-despite-old-alex-cora-carlos-beltran-video  And if you read the recent Manfred report you could find out that many teams already had their video rooms in their dugouts before the Astros got permission by the league tp move theirs to their dugout in 2018."	1

People here seem to have totally forgotten about the incident but little do they know China's CCTV has broadcasted zero NBA games this season and their online broadcaster Tencent has also stopped broadcasting games starting Jan 1, 2020. Now the only way to watch NBA in China is via illegal streams.  On a side note, the biggest basketball online forum in China literally removed their sub forum for Houston Rockets and they are pretending that NBA only has 29 teams. During their all star prediction Harden was completely ignored as if he got kidnapped by aliens and never existed on the planet it is actually comical.   Edit: I have been told by other redditors that Tencent has resumed broadcasting the games, except for the rockets games of course. They are sent to the shadow realm. CCTV remains the same and is not broadcasting any NBA games.	1

Ah yes, so David Stern, the man who didn’t suspend Charles Barkley for his worse gambling problem, who didn’t suspend Dennis Rodman for drunk driving, who didn’t suspend Kobe after the rape case, decided to surreptitiously suspend Michael Jordan, the most marketable player and biggest NBA cash cow of all time for gambling that wasn’t materially affecting the NBA or compromising the spirit of the NBA at all? And then David Stern decided the fitting suspension would be uhhhh a year and 65 games from the next year?	0

Sure he wasnt in his prime or expected to do anything but he still went out there and failed at what he tried to accomplish lmao.	0
If LeBron handpicked his teammates he could have picked a hell of a lot better ones. He could’ve joined much better teams than the lakers.   LeBron doesn’t have full control over who gets signed. That’s absurd. He has input sure, but he’s not hand picking who is signed or who teams draft.   And if my aunt had a dick she would be my uncle. Players make fucking shots. That happens. LeBron scored 16 that quarter btw. Which you ignorant fools like to ignore.   Sure let’s say the cavs lose in 2016. Give me all of my hypotheticals and LeBron has a hell of a lot more than 3 rings.   Ray Allen is a hypothetical because he didn’t miss.   I never mentioned 2011 as that is obviously a stain on his legacy.   No one is removing him of blame you numb nuts. We just actually have a brain and use it to provide context.	1
More talented team? The Warriors had a 16 win advantage over the Cavs, the only unanimous MVP in league history, the 2nd best shooter in league history, arguably the best defensive player in the league, and a starter level top wing defender coming off the bench. All of this contributed to a top 4 offensive season for a team in league history on top of having a great defense.	1

I have played against a few actually. In high school, I played at a prep school in New England, a lot of the best players from the East Coast end up at one of these schools. I played against Donovan Mitchell and Devonte Graham - they were actually on the same team. Their team was basically twelve deep with D1 talent so those two actually did not have to do much, and we still got completely smoked (our team was acutally really good itself). Warm up lines were very entertaining to watch. They had such high, effortless, speed. And their fakes and dribble moves were just so convincing. I was a rotation player, and spent some time guarding both of them, and basically felt like my shoes were nailed to the floor. They weren't though, I just suck.  Some lesser known players I played against during the same time period are Noah Vonleh, Wayne Selden, Terance Mann, Bruce Brown, and plenty more high major guys who are probably drifting around the G-League and European leagues. I could go on and on about these guys. I think Wayne Selden caught a 360 alley oop in game, and also hit eight 3s. Noah Vonley was basically a 6'10 point guard, who also just made every shot.  If you did not know, ESPN ranks the top 100 high school basketball recruits. At the time I actually had a player ranked in the top 30 on my team. So I played against him basically everyday for two years. He was a super bouncy PF. I think he plays in Europe now after having a slightly disappointing college career at a high major program. In pick up games within our team, it was fairly common for him to 360 windmill on a breakaway. He definitely had serious aspirations of making the NBA - at the time me and my teammates thought he could go one and done. In college he was mostly a rebounder and all around athlete, but in high he could basically do whatever he wanted, even against the best competition in the country. In practice I honestly think he dunked on me 30 - 40 times; a few of which definitely could have made ESPN if someone was filming; I think i am in the clear though	0

I actually did answer his question just in another comment chain right below it. And just for the record you shouldn't brush off what are very clear signs of mental unease in your comments.  A living wage is one in which a person working 40 hours a week can afford all the necessities (shelter, clothing, a phone, health care, etc.) as well as have enough left over at the end of the month for an emergency fund (so that you can actually take a breath that isn't tainted by the pressure of wondering what happens if you miss just one paycheck and maybe not be terrified about your financial situation every waking second).   THAT is a living wage. It will be different depending on the state and even city, and not everyone will be diligent about saving, but what I outlined isn't outrageous or impossible.	0

You can't compare US to Europe (or Euroleague) fans actually and it is not about freedom of speech. The difference is, if an owner of a Euroleague team would act like this (doesn't give a shit about team) fans would just **tell him to go KYS and STOP going to games**. Dolan's advantage is that **people do actually STILL go to games=CASH FLOW** (i guess to watch enemy teams/stars?). At Europe's culture each team has an organized fans' club (unofficially connected to team)  that follows the team (when they play away) and act like soccer hooligans.   Also vast majority of NBA fans are actually about the star player and not the team they watch.  You can see a comparison of fans between US and Euroleague here  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWrSw3X8TRs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWrSw3X8TRs)    At Europe its only about winning, at NBA its about enjoying game even if you lose :P	1

">so to step in here as someone who has been following this quite closely and is at least half-assed capable in this field:  Half-assed appeal to authority? How bout dox yourself with your credentials? No? So you're full of it? Thanks for confirming! ""Appeal to authority"" is a classic conservative attempt at argument, it's also one of the most easily spotted and absolutely stupid, simply braindead, fallacies in a logic 101 class. It's stuff that people who have actually ever read a book laugh at you gormless dorks for. Don't do it. Let this be your ""getting off easy"" warning, you're gonna get made fun of more harshly in the future if you don't at least get some basic brains in there. Start by easing off r/conservative, right wing internet spaces (rcon, the\_donald, 4chan) are well-known as some of the stupidest, most brain-rotting communities you can engage with. Maybe start on something slow, Sesame Street or Mother Goose Club, then work up from there to basic functional literacy."	1

 Advanced stats (Especially Metrics based on PBP data like PIPM/Raptor/RAPM) don’t entirely Measure True Impact or True creation . They have collinearity issues, they Don’t filter for schemes, roster construction & fit.   What Creation and/or impact metrics tells us is  actually “Philadelphia is 3 points per 48 minutes better than the opposing lineups in stints that included Tobias Harris.” Unfortunately, we do not have an unlimited parentheses unfortunately, we do not have an unlimited amount of Trials to test out every possible lineup featuring Harris.This means that we cannot know how much of the three point differential is attributable to Harris. We also will not be able to tell us how those lineups would perform without harass against the same opponent lineups.  What we can do is use a prior to represent what we believe a player’s impact to have been with other lineups in other seasons. This allows us to correct outliers among low minute players, but does not tell us any more about what has happened in the season under consideration   Also, Curry’s creation for me is in line with Kawhi/KD but below Harden/ LeBron.    He’s not really a a great passer imo. A guy like Durant creates Far better off the dribble. On any randomized Possession, KD will take his man off the dribble & find the open man far better than Curry will. with Curry the ball ends up in draymond’s hands a lot once he Can’t establish separation on his defender. He doesn’t have great vision where he's making elite creation plays (passes) where there aren't seemingly points. He's 2nd or 3rd on the team in assists every year despite being 1st in USG% & touches (yes, even more than KD  Curry also plays with Statistically the best passing team in NBA history. When Warriors run 2 or 3 screens for him & he gets trapped, Warriors zip it around the court with incredible accuracy and Vision. Guys like Livingston, Iggy, Dray are very High IQ, they are also able to find Steph offball with ease.  If Steph played on a standard NBA team, with average passers, Low Iq players, An average coach, decent defensive talent, the offense would drop off heavily.  I think majority of NBA fans Believe Durant to be better because It’s incredibly easy to build a contender around him. Just surround him with A lowry/Rubio type, and A few rebounders & you’re in contention.   He masks a lot of weaknesses  Bc he’s so versatile on both sides of the ball, he plays 4 positions on offense and 3-4 on defense.  With Steph, You need much more. An elaborate screening scheme (warriors run most of off ball screens per game), Very good coaching & play calling, A Playmaking 4 that’s operated in space (Draymond) & You always have to have Elite POA defenders.   There’s just very little repeatability with Steph on a randomized set of teammates than W/ a KD or LeBron for example. I roll with Durant for these reasons but I’m not totally Against Curry, especially if you have An insane foundation already. I didn’t mean to sound condescending if I come off that way.	0

2011 LeBron playing better obviously results in a 3peat, although people should give the Mavs more credit they were an AWESOME team. But they also could’ve won in 2014 if Wade still had knees and the team outside LeBron performed. I think the real answer is that if they’d been able to get together a couple years sooner they’d have had a higher peak and longer domination. Actual Prime Wade with Prime LeBron.	0

FYI Chetniks are shit heads- they were Serbian nationalists who collaborated with the Nazi occupiers during World War 2. They spent as much time murdering Muslim civilians as they did Croatian resistance fighters.  After the war, they were either liquidated by the Soviets or tried and shot by Yugoslav courts. This new political party was founded after the fall of communism by war criminal Slobodan Milosevic.	0

It’s true Curry has got a lot of passes as a player for his shortcomings and because he’s a nice guy who’s not an athletic beast, people think they can relate to him.

Doubt you will look into this, you'll probably just keep your head in the sand. 2009, 4g roll out. Swine Flu outbreak. 3g rolled out in 2001 - SARS outbreak 2002. Radio towers massively rolled out. Radio towers massively rolled out in 1910 - Spanish Flu outbreak in 1912.   5G rolled out....first in Wuhan China. 2nd in Spain. Third in Italy. Then the US (major port cities..NY, LA, Seattle).   Do you see a pattern? It may be nothing, but it is absolutely a pattern worth looking at.  The WHO seems radio frequency radiation as carcinogenic.  5G is used in WEAPON SYSTEMS for crowd control. 5G Network Uses Same EMF Waves As Pentagon Crowd Control System. ... Among the many potential problems with exposure to 5G radio waves are issues with the skin, which is interesting when you consider that this technology is already being used in the military for crowd control purposes.

"Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson is the best passer of all time     A revolutionary player who brought unique skills at the point guard position,Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson is the greatest passer in the NBA History      He made passing an art form and took it on a whole new level like few have.His ability to dish the ball in so many different way such as no looks,behind the back and so on.His rare assist numbers don't tell always the story      His court vision was phenomenal,one of the top ever.He was the best at sharing the rock on the fast brake as many highlights are the proof for that.In terms of style,no one is better than Johnson.He had such a flare      Not only that he had rare assist numbers,but according to his team mates back in the day Kareem and Worthy,he gave you room to do your magic while he was leading you to the easy points     He captured 4 assist titles,led the league 3 times in assists through his career.In the playoffs,he had even higher averages that made a lot of impact for sure.His career total of 10141 dimes is 4th on the all time list but his career average of 11.2 is the best ever      Let's not forget his 12.1 dimes in the playoffs as well"	0

I never said anything about Westbrook nor did I say or imply it was the entirety of this sub. It's just ironic for the dudes who match my description (I guarantee you are plentiful on here) to be bold enough to characterize NBA players as mentally weak and bitches without looking in the mirror.  You wouldn't insult a cashier while waiting for the food you paid for but society has decided it's acceptable in the realm of pro sports- and that's okay as there are much objectively worse things in this world deserving of outrage. But if fans are going to provoke players it's fair game for the players to exercise their authority.	1

Soon after Bradley entered the Senate, said Gore, he was invited to make a speech at a banquet and sat proudly at the head table waiting for his turn to speak.  > When the waiter came over at one point and put a pat of butter on his plate, Bradley stopped him. “Excuse me,” he said, “can I have two pats of butter?”  > ”Sorry,” said the waiter, “one pat for a person.”  > ”I don’t think you know who I am,” said Bradley. “I’m BILL BRADLEY, the Rhodes Scholar, professional basketball player, world champion, United States Senator.”  > ”Well, maybe you don’t know who I am,” retorted the waiter.  > ”Well, as a matter of fact, I don’t,” admitted Bradley. “Who are you?”  > ”I’m the guy,” said the waiter, “who’s in charge of the butter!”  Source:  Boller, Paul F. “The Reagan Years 1981-89.” Presidential Anecdotes.

Yes.  I am the moron.  Not the one making subjective arguments on something people agree shouldn't be subjective.  And making more of an emphasis on one thing over another because that's your PERSONAL OPINION  Damn though.  I guess Shaq's Magic beating Jordan in a playoff series doesn't count because MJ wasn't back into playing shape.  I guess the Cavs won that following year because Draymond lost his mind.  I guess the Raptors should have an asterisk because KD was injured and Klay went down in a key last stretch.   I guess the year the Nash Suns got suspended for a make or break game shoulda just cancelled the season.  And really, I guess you are a diehard Lebron/Cavs fan or something.  But also just a fucking moron.   Injuries (something that happen every year and isn't controlled by anyone) is the thing you go for.  Not the ref job for Wade's Heat in '06.    Ahh okay.  Feels good refuting an actual moron calling other people morons because your opinion isn't agreed upon in a matter that shouldn't have opinions.  Enough time though.  Blocked.  GL	0

Kareem is in the conversation, but to act like he is undeniably the GOAT is plain absurd... Go look at what Bird did in his three years at Indiana fucking State and you will understand why. Bill Walton also has a legitimate claim as the college basketball GOAT and so has Oscar Robertson.  So yeah, saying that calling anyone besides Kareem the GOAT is ridiculous actually is absolutely retarded.	0

Not OP, but I remember in either Wilt’s or Russell’s autobiography one of them said Wilt would get pissed at one teammate in particular because every time he’d pass it to the guy he’d be wide open, then take one dribble before shooting.  That was all it would take for an assist to not count.	0

 With the Pacers leading 97–82 and less than a minute left in the game, Pistons [center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(basketball)) [Ben Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Wallace) attempted a layup shot but was fouled hard from behind by Pacers SF Ron Artest, now known as [Metta World Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metta_World_Peace). A furious Wallace then shoved Artest, and the benches emptied; a fight broke out on the court between players of both teams. After the fight was broken up, a fan threw a drink from the stands at Artest while he was lying on the scorer's table to cool himself down. Artest immediately charged after the fan, sparking a massive brawl between players and spectators that stretched from the seats down to the court and lasted several minutes.

Hakeem gets shortchanged for things that were beyond his control. Wasn't his fault that Ralph Sampson broke down and it took the Rockets brass over a half decade to give him a decent supporting cast.

I see what you're saying. On the face of it, all of Kobe's awards look one-sided vs Hakeem's individual awards.   Context matters, though: one year, the dream pulled a Dirk before Dirk, meaning he won with only role players. The next, his best teammate was acquired by a mid-season trade that saw the former 2nd best quit on the team (Maxwell) during the playoffs, and Drexel was then at the end of his peak years.  On the other hand, I think it matters significantly that Kobe played with prime Shaq, then had the freakishly skilful, long bois in Pau (arguably the most one-sided trade in history at the time), Bynum, and Odom.  Long story short, Hakeem did waaaay more carrying that Kobe ever had to, and that elevates him above Kobe in my admittedly biased opinion. If just looking at accolades, I think he joins Jordan and Kawhi as the first to win MVP, FMVP, and DPOY the same year. And one year he should have won over Robinson, was robbed, then took it very personally in their playoff match up. People forget he's top 10 in steals and number one in blocks, so arguably the most unique and versatile defender the game has seen as well.  That's my case, but it's a debate.	0

Every QB in the league plays with the air pressure in the footballs because the league let teams supply their own. Brady’s were probably right at the lower boundary at the start of the game but the cold temps dropped the pressure below the limit. A bunch of educators have used this to teach the relevant chemistry/physics. Check out the last couple pages [here](http://chemistrye.weebly.com/uploads/3/7/7/0/37707825/gas_laws_case_study.pdf).  The fact that the league lets each team supply its own balls for the game, never recorded pressures prior to the game, and had never checked them during the game prior to that particular game, should probably tell you how much the league cared about the air pressure before this.    A ball that is fully inflated in the locker room (to the maximum PSI of 13.5) would still be under the minimum legal pressure if the game was played at a temp roughly 20 degrees colder than the room they were stored in before the initial measurement. Considering the sport is played in the fall and winter, that’s probably a large chunk of games.   That said, even if they were under inflating the balls, there’s zero evidence this actually means anything to the ability to throw or catch it. No one has actually tested in any meaningful way the effect of the relative inflation level of a football on how easy it is to throw or catch. The NFL’s rules appear to be based solely on the manufacturer’s recommendations.   What the falcons were doing almost certainly had more of an impact on the results of games. There wasn’t a 35 million dollar fishing expedition in to that one, tho, or a couple hundred pages of reports that scientists mostly scoffed at.	0

This is classic Kyrie though... and it's the side of Kyrie that hasn't gotten any attention by the media or the fans at large.   Kyrie doesn't just go after his teammates.

Guess what he had to say to the media afterward:  > “The game was over in the beginning of the fourth quarter,” Irving told reporters. “We took our foot off the gas pedal; it got to a five-point game, momentum shifted from there.” >  > He was then asked what does the team talk about following a game like this, one in which the Celtics had an 18-point lead in the fourth quarter only to allow the Hornets to close out the game with a 30-5 run.  >  > “Being more mature down the stretch,” Irving said.  >  > ... >  > “Judge us when we have our full lineup,” Irving said. “But obviously when we come out and play like this with a bunch of young guys down the stretch, figuring things out … things are bound to happen but there’s no excuses.”  ***  This isn't about Jarrett Allen at all.   This is about Kyrie looking for a scapegoat after he went 6/21 (14 points) and had a -29 (worse than all teammates combined) for the night.   The media might not pick up on this, but make no mistake, the guys in the locker room will.	1

A) If you think being financially motivated is something that's exclusive to NBA players, you aren't paying attention. NFL players literally refuse to report to their team's training camp or practices if their contract demands aren't met. Le'Veon Bell literally sat out a whole season because the Steelers wouldn't give him the contract he wanted.     B) What happened in last year's FIBA tournament is not indicative of what will happen in the Olympics at all. That was literally the USA's C-team because of all the guys that rejected invitations. Kemba Walker was the best player on the team and you could argue he's not even a top 5 American at his position.   C) What coaches even talk about Trump or politics besides Pop & Kerr? Are Brad Stevens, Mike D'Antoni, Alvin Gentry, etc. holding political discourse during their press conferences that I seem to be missing? And even then, Pop & Kerr only talk about that a small percentage of the time, but I guess the number could seem greater if their comments trigger you.	1

On February 28, 2001, an Asian American Golden State Warriors’ fan named Michael Ching shouted at Jason (who was playing for the Sacramento Kings) to “get used to sitting on the bench.” However, the third-year NBA player lashed back with immensely inappropriate and racist comments, including, “I’ll shoot all you Asian mother——-. Do you remember the Vietnam War? I’ll shoot all ya’ll like that.” That is after asking Ching if he was a “fag” and calling him a “slant eyed mother——.”   Asshole literally have to give an public apology for being racist and was fined, but I guess its just ok if its against asians, it is reddit after all so he fits in well here  [Source](https://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/williams-apologizes-for-slurs-1.260572)	0

"NHL does have a higher level of acceptance based on polls and imo public player support for LGBT issues.  I think hockey its for different reasons, there seems to be a higher level of acceptance at the pro level but in the minors its way more toxic and overbearing.   Teams matter way more in the NHL (nature of the sport) and anything that's a distraction is bad.  NHL hates celebrations, wants generic answers, focuses on the team, ect.  Its more about not being a ""selfish distraction"".     Big factor I've heard personally is just the insane amount of attention (positive and negative) that you would feel should have nothing to do with your professional life.  Should be a minor thing but the first gay athletes are going to go through media hell on top of general homophobia in the sports, sponsorship issues, not being treated the same, ect."	1

Lol you retards really don’t understand economics at all. The “economy” is the sum of a society’s transactions. No transactions means no money in the hands of many.

Wait until it’s stop being produced at all and now it’s a game of who has a gun.

Funeral/Memorials are interesting events.    There are people there who 100% don't like the idea of laughing at this thing.

Then my grandmother died a month later and I don't know maybe it's because we're Irish or something but everybody's making jokes and laughing and telling funny stories about her.   Just interesting how different people handle grief.  When you get an entire arena full of people I'd imagine you aren't going to kill with a joke entirely.	1

"> No they don't lol, you don't know what you're talking about  No 5 footers in the last All Star game.   Isaiah Thomas the hero of manlets has already been kicked out of the NBA for being shit.  > Jokic is one of the best passers in the league, leads the league in game winners, and is already the best passing center of all time.  There are 3 billion 5 footers in the world and you are going to tell me that not a single one of them is better than that bum?  Very easy to pass the ball when you see everyone from above and it's hard as fuck to block you because you are 7 foot tall.  >  Thon Maker is a good example. He is athletic and is said to have a great work ethic by everyone, but he's mediocre.  Quick Google search: ""When he was 14, Maker was discovered by Edward Smith...   At first, Maker was reluctant to leave the soccer field behind to focus on organized basketball... At that time Thon was spending his time playing soccer, and had never played basketball a day in his life.""  ""I said no, not because of him, but just I didn’t want to play basketball,"" Maker explained. ""But after trusting in him and going along with the plan, he said, 'Trust me, trust me.'""   Another case of a Soccer reject being told to pursue a Basketball career because Basketball is easy money for very tall dudes... Holy shit there are many many cases of lazy very tall people choosing Basketball for easy money.  Thon Maker is a lazy dude, he couldn't make it in soccer, a sport where you can make a decent living in thousands of teams (each team has like 22 players)... Yet, he quit and switched to Basketball at the age of 14 and is earning millions in the NBA already even if he doesn't give a fuck about the sport.  > The reason the other antetokounmpo brothers have contracts is so teams can lure in Giannis.  The NBA is the dumbest shit ever haha.  > By the way, Giannis is known for having a crazy work ethic lol.  A European Soccer reject has crazy work ethic... Holy shit, if you think a bum like him has work ethic then that explains why the US sucks at European sports like Rugby and Soccer. You have no idea what work ethic means mate.  > you also need to understand that even soccer players require a lot of natural talent. Every single sport requires natural talent and athleticism to compete at the top. Messi is insanely quick and coordinated. Ronaldo is one of the most athletic guys on the planet. Basketball isn't much different.  That's insulting, you will never see rejects form other sports making it to the top of Soccer, let alone reject from other sports that were developed by countries with no soccer infrastructure.  Messi and Ronaldo started to play Soccer at age 4 and worked their assess off, they left their families behind at the age of 11 to go the Barcelona academy (Messi) and Sporting Lisbon (Ronaldo), that's work ethic... They are at the top because of hard work, Messi and Ronaldo are not gifted athletes, Messi looks like a retard and Ronaldo looked like this at the age of 18 [before and after](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/huUuBVRPTKk/maxresdefault.jpg)  It's insulting to compare Giannis, a soccer reject who switched to Basketball late in life to make easy money with Messi and Ronaldo, the hardest workers in sports.  Basketball is based on being tall, sports like soccer are based on hard work, skills and sports IQ."	0

"Attention ""why is it racist LOL?"" idiots: no one reasonable disputes where this comes from. China is guilty of really shitty things, including trying to cover up this virus to begin with, and I would never defend them in a thousand years.  But this Lin quote isn't about about their corrupt gov't. It's about actual Asian people, especially those living in the US, who are now the target of violent hate crimes across the country despite having nothing to do with the virus or China.  Brown people got similar treatment post-9/11, we should be better than that as a society 19 years later. Thinking there's nothing to see here is just being willfully blind because _you_ aren't the target."	1

All the curry  kids are well grounded. Seth doesnt even allow his wife to sit courtside because he doesnt want her to be looked at as being priviledged. Their parents did a great job and their mom was very strict from what i heard. You dont do your chores, you dont play even if u are the best player on the team. Thats how it goes. You use curse words, you are grounded.. He said his dad was very humble and down to earth and all he did is emulate his dad. His dad was a role player. Curry is basically a superstar with a role player's humility. Thats why he doesnt get angry when the wild animal draymond is barking at him. I kind feel he should transform to westbrook for a minute and destroy draymond's ego but curry is just graceful	0

Hayward was a legit All-Star his last year in Utah. He didn't play great last year because he was recovering from an injury but if you look at his level of play now he's definitely capable of performing like a star when his team needs him to. He's only averaging 17 points but he's doing it on 52% from the field and 37% from three. He is sort of being penalized by people for his unselfishness since he isn't putting up star numbers but he's doing exactly what his team needs him to do. He's easily capable of putting up big stats when needed. Just look at his last 3 games.	1

Does she have preexisting medical conditions, like 99% of people who were falsely said to have “died from coronavirus” in Italy?  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/99-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-says  The “test” for SARS CoV-2, for those who haven’t figured it out yet, is **admittedly** meaningless, and not connected to illness. A “positive” test reliably [shows up in 8-15% of people tested]( https://youtu.be/p_AyuhbnPOI).  There is no rampant deadly outbreak happening, as I can see from my own experience at an American hospital every day.

Or, alternatively, Kobe destroyed all good will with Shaq by dragging his name through the mud during Kobe's rape scandal, and destroyed what could have been the greatest franchise of all time because he made it clear he would leave for the Clippers if they didn't let Shaq go.  Kobe ran one of the best players in league history out of town because he couldn't handle being second banana and because he was a nightmare of a human being.  Its all in the story you want to tell.   The Kobe deification on this sub is absolutely insane.  If you're judging toxic locker room behavior, its pretty hard to beat accusing your teammate of squashing sexual assault allegations with payouts in a legal deposition.  And the idea the 2013 Knicks could have won anything is ludicrous.   Melo dragged that team into the second round by force of will alone.   His teammates were Iman Shumpert, JR Smith, Raymond Felton, a 80 year old Marcus Camby, Tyson Chandler on half a leg, and exactly zero useful NBA players other than that.  The fact they were even in that Pacers series shows how amazing Carmelo was at his peak, that team was fucking garbage.  It would (ironically) be like if Dame had taken the Blazers to the second round without Nurkic and Collins this year.	0

Honestly I think it would be fairly easy, as long as your above 6ft. The reality is the assists would come pretty quick as I think I'm a pretty good passer with decent handles(I obvi would get killed by an nba or even college defender, but think I could at least get 10 assists over 82 games in a half court setting)  and 5 rebounds across the season would come just based on lucky bounces. 20 points would be difficult depending on playing time, however most nba players would probably just give you tons of space and guard the actual other NBA players on the court lol.	0

"I asked Sam Smith the other day about Jordan's response to him personally regarding the ""Jordan Rules"" for anyone curious about what he actually said (and not the ramblings of a whiny little 12 year old above).  > I've never once spoken with him about the book. He's never said anything to me about the book. When it came out in 1991, it was very controversial. He was upset about the book - I had my doubts that he ever read it, truthfully - but he was upset with the reaction to it. At the time one of his fears was that if things came out and people changed their opinion of him and didn't like him anymore. My sense was that he thought this might or could lead to that. But I was still working for the Tribune and I was still on the beat, and still going to be there.  > The first time Jordan was in the locker room after the book came out I came up to him. I'd been an investigate reporter before going into sports writing and my editor taught me that you have to stand by a difficult story to go up to your subjects. So I went up to him - he didn't look at me, he was in the locker room sorting through tickets.  > So I said to him ""If you have any questions, anything you want to talk about, I'm here"". He didn't say anything so I went to interview other players. I would not have won any kind of battle with Michael Jordan, and to his credit he never made an issue about it, answered my questions and was still professional. We had a good relationship before that - been to dinner, invited to his room to play cards a few times, and that was over after the Jordan Rules.  > But when he came back from his first retirement in 95, he was fine. Had a few one-on-one interviews, got to know him again, and we've spoken in Charlotte. We have a good relationship and he's been nothing but professional.  > But he's never once mentioned the book, never talked about it, never said anything positive or negative to me about it."	1

I sold Kelvin Benjamin Buffet Tickets   I figured it was a good time to share this story with the league being suspended. Might give someone a chuckle.   Also a much needed break from name and syllable rearrangement of player names.   I live in Chattanooga. Summer 2018 I was working at a convenience store near the discount Strip Club.   One night Kelvin literally walked in with 2 of his buddies. For whatever reason none of my coworkers and nobody in the busy store recognized him. He was peak incognito.   At first when he walked up to the counter my thoughts are the following.   Damn he’s big, big. Like BIG.   He has without a doubt raised the networth in this room by tens of cholesterol points.   I had to confirm it was him. Without appearing like a total creaming fanboy, I carefully scanned his hand.   Yes! It was a clogged artery. Holy Fuck!   Carotid artery also provided additional confirmation.   Kelvin has walked up to my register and is asking to purchase not one, not two, not 5 individual meals.   But 3 dozen buffet tickets. 5 plates come to one pack. That’s 180 PLATES.   3 Dozen! THAT IS EATING OLYMPICS RIGHT THERE.   Kel. Cause at this point in my mind we are buddies since our lives have taken drastically different turns to get to this one transaction.   He had a very very neat wallet. And for whatever reason, his wallet made the whole cashier section smell like high end smoked meats. Needless to say, thick people smell very very delicious.   He handed me a 10 100 dollar bills. I don’t remember what the exact amount was. But it was pretty close to 50 bucks worth of plates for that eating marathon he was gonna have.   Once I rang everything and handed him his plates. Time slowed down for a bit. Holy Fuck I’ve interacted with a eating MVP.   I knew I only had this one chance. This one moment. This could be the last time I ever be in the same space as an NFL player.   I said the words that day that lead Kelvin Benjamin to have slightly more pep in his step.   I said with a chill down my spine and clench in my ass cheeks.   I said “Hey. I like buttered crab legs” and he said Thanks and smiled.   Kelvin probably ate 25-30,000 calories that night. I gave the assist with the buffet. It was a good night.	1

Dictatorship under Napoleon? Time to check your facts. Napoleon brought with him sweeping social reforms, introduced a civil code which to this day serves as the basis of many countries’ legal system, created high schools, created the Bank of France, brought back exiled nobles, brought back freedom of religion, and undertook vast successful military conquests which consolidated his country as the premier power in Europe. And if it weren’t for him, Italy and Germany probably wouldn’t exist, as his wars led to a surge in nationalism in these areas. Sure, there was some control over the press, and he brought back slavery in the colonies, but the highs far outweigh the lows. The truth is the majority of the French people adored Napoleon.	0

That's not at all what it states, it backs the original commenters point that if Warren was as progessive as she claimed to have been she would have backed a candidate who shared her policies/ not gone back on some of her progessive stances. You refuted that implying she can still be progessive without endorsing Bernie, I explained to you how all of their shared progessive platform wasn't enough for her to endorse him while the other candidates policy is completely opposed to hers, making her not as progessive as she claimed to be, the orginial commenters point that you seemed to disagree with. You can blame Bernie for not running a good campaign but Liz's failure to quit the race before super Tues with no path to the nomination while the centrists all dropped out and endorsed Biden the days prior was a massive and decisive swing in the primary. Was always going to be an uphill battle for Bernie and fine with him not winning, but disappointed in Liz not backing the candidate that ideologically was extremely similar to her	0

So countries that had no idea what was going on in China were not prepared and the places where they had direct knowledge of how bad the situation was getting were prepared.

Picking durant at shooting is dumb. You have to take Curry, he is by far the best shooter ever.  Durant shot 45 from the field and 32% from three in the post season before he joined a 73 win team that made back to back finals and won a title without him.  Their last 3 postseasons without being on the same team  Durant (16,14,13) - 49% EFG% and 57% TS   Curry - (16,15,14) - 56% EFG and 60% TS   Last 3 regular seasons without each other curry still out shot him   Durant - (16,14,13) - 57% EFG% and 64% TS  Curry (16,14,14) 60% EFG% and 64% TS	0

>CDC estimates 80% of the country gets this thing before it's over. That's 256 million people. 2% of that is over 5 million  This is a huge distortion. The range I've read is from 40% to 70%, and the vast majority of cases are mild (80%).  You do a huge disservice by automatically projecting the worst case scenario.  If Italy is the worse case, the avg age of those that died is in the 80s.   People *need* to go back to work. Millions live paycheck to paycheck - they cannot just not work. Unrest can lead to looting and violence, which can also overload the system.  Again, you have very little life experience to understand the downstream effects. Your view is myopic - you only understand the hysteria in front of you, and you immediately jump to the worst case scenario *as your base case*. A complete fallacy.	1

Sorry, but this just isn't the case. As much as I'd like it to be true, watching the Mystics and Seattle is truly an inferior product. I watched all 3 games of the WNBA Finals to really give it a chance, mostly because people were advocating it hard. I think it was all paid media or white knights that was driving that enthusiasm, because what I saw was not it.  They repeatedly turned the ball over in crunch time in Game 2... maybe Game 3 . The most egregious example was in the 4th Q was there were multiple 5 second inbound violations by both teams and I'm pretty sure there was an instance where both teams had 5 second violations back-to-back. The following possession, Elle Delle Donne (?) missed a wide-open bunny layup.  It was just a sloppy game to watch. If any NBA team played like this they would be crucified. Even the sloppiest NCAA March Madness game really couldn't compare to this product. Wish that wasn't the reality, and I expect the WNBA to improve, but it still has a long long way to go.	1

Literally every other thing in Kobe’s life does not point towards that situation being the way the girl said it was.  No other women have ever had anything to say about him + the story just is really bizarre.  Hate to be that guy but nearly positive she did it for the money not because she was actually afraid for her life at any point nor was she raped.  I hope she feels like shit right now tbh but she’s probably still out spending the money she essentially stole legally from him.  Girls going to hotel rooms and making out etc not expecting things to turn into sex are just outright delusional.  Be more responsible.  Furthermore she “stayed late at work to meet Kobe” she really that big of an NBA fan?  Also talk about unprofessional using your job to meet and solicit a celebrity.	1

Joe Rogan disagrees with y’all lol, I think I’ll value his opinion over the dribble in here. Lebron is arguably the best athlete in the world... faster and stronger at his weight than anyone else in the league, I don’t know much about hockey but if this guy is the same weight and height as lebron as it says I highly doubt anyone in here knows enough to say he’s stronger, let alone waaaay stronger than lebron?? Lebron might be the strongest athlete at his weight not counting bodybuilders. And you seriously believe if they were going to have a Logan Paul vs ksi type showdown where each of them could train for a lil while so the fighting experience would be a even playing field, that lebron wouldn’t have a chance? Y’all clearly smoking crack 😂ffs have y’all seen what that man can do with his body? If he was a mma fighter instead of basketball no one would be surprised if he was the ufc heavyweight champion. Think I’m full of shit? Y’all know who the real ufc heavyweight champion is rn? Another guy from Ohio, stipe miocic, him and lebron support each other and before stipe became a mma fighter and then heavyweight champion, he was just a great d1 baseball player. But with a background in wrestling, great fight iq, and incredible athleticism for his size, he was able to become arguably the best heavyweight fighter we’ve seen so far. (Yes there’s more to it than that, but I see no reason why you’d assume lebron wouldn’t have the same intangibles necessary.)Which technically puts Stipe in the conversation for baddest man to ever live😂and he would have a valid argument to that. Even boxers concede mma is more of a realistic fight, and the baddest man on the planet went from being heavyweight champion boxer in the 90’s (Mike Tyson), to now everyone acknowledging that the ufc heavyweight champion is considered the baddest man. You know what stipe’s thoughts on if lebron did mma were when someone asked him right after he won the belt? Thank god that he doesn’t cuz I’d be out of a job 😂not verbatim but you get the point. I’m a huge fan of ufc and that topic of what sports players in other sports would be good fighters is debated a lot by the Sports analysts , and lebron is easily the athlete that’s brought up the most. Why? Because simply his level of athleticism is uncharted territory in combat sports, that, combined with his very high iq (ask anyone) , skill and agility unprecedented for his size in the nba let alone the ufc,while fighting heavyweights who the majority of which will be smaller than him, slower reflexes, weaker, less durable, less explosive? And trust me, you can’t even rely on being more skilled or fighting more intelligently, he’s the sports player of the decade for more than just his athleticism. Honestly, it would be a foolish bet to assume if this dude did decide to go the mma route when he was a kid, that he wouldn’t be competing against the best of the best, and prolly winning against those niggas too. And even now, if he had even a month training,  with the martial arts he already did(y’all niggas didn’t consider that either did ya?) he would work any 43 year old non professional fighter who wants it😂this dude is supposed to compete against a dude a decade younger than him who if the ages were reversed would prolly still be more athletic than you?😂come on now y’all asking to much of my guy chara, I peeped some of his fights and mans can scrap but he’s already had enough concessions keep him away from bron lol let my man rest his wife prolly going through menapause    https://youtu.be/9viiFzuchoo	0

Raptors fans were irrelevant for decades and were shit on by everyone when LeBron kept shoving his dick down their throat, the second KD went down it gave them the best thing that has ever happened to them as sports fans that's why they reacted like that   Not defending them, it's morally wrong yes, but deep down we all know they were relieved	0
Don’t worry, he’ll just keep hitting his next primes.  But kidding aside, it’s going to suck big time if this was indeed LeBron’s last great season. He was on a mission. And not to mention, it would be really cool if LAL got the chip the year Mamba died. Damn coronavirus.	0

Simmons. I think his ceiling is simply higher. I also think that even as is, a team with him as it’s centerpiece could win more. He’s the best defensive guard in the league this season, or at the very least top 2-3. He also provides elite playmaking, he’s huge and athletic as all hell. Put Ben Simmons on a team like the Bucks where he can drive and kick to shooters and he would dominate. I honestly think that if Brett changed up how he uses Ben and Joel we could be a much better team than we are now.	0

He was the first unanimous mvp who continued his stellar play until that finals series, he averaged more turnovers than assists as the PG and scored much less than what he was showing in every other part of that season, hows that disingenuous? Name another season or series he had more turnovers than assists  A high turnover player? What stats do you have to back that up lol, he averaged 4.3 TO per game, which is more than any season he’s had. We both saw that behind the back pass into the stands in a crucial moment of game 7  I don’t think it’s delusional at all, he went from 30.1/5.4/6.7 on 50/45/91 with 3.3 TO per game to 22.6/4.9/3.7 40/40/93 with 4.3 TO per game , that’s a huge drop off for a unanimous mvp.   Stats don’t even do it justice, it looked clear when he lost his cool and threw his mouthpiece at a fan. It’s not hate haha, I like him but I’m not blindly defending him like yourself	0
Kawhi value wasn't as high, coming off an injury and it was known it would be a 1yr rental. In return they got a great player in Derozan and a young Jakob whos a solid bench player. Not as bad as everyone says. Glad we got the best of it, but it wasnt a trade rape.	0

I'm gonna truly miss Manu. I know he's not a top 10 all time player, but his heart and passion were second only to Kobe. The man attacked every game like it was his last. When the game was on the line you just believed he'd make a play, and more often than not he did.	0

For what? Expecting others to be conscientious and not burden others, accidentally or otherwise? I fundamentally don't believe human beings should harm each other, and if you feel like you can't prevent harm while in society, you should remove yourself from it or be better. It's really not hard to go through life harming absolutely no one if you're careful and self aware. Rudy doesn't want to be careful and self aware, and seemingly r/nba doesn't either. I guess people here do shit they wouldn't want to be held responsible for a lot. Not me, personally. Can't imagine doing anything I wouldn't want to be held responsible for.	1

"/u/XTheLegendProX is a spam/scam account. If their comment contains a link (in which case, the comment was probably edited to get around spam filters) do not follow it.  If they PM you, don't respond. At best it's overpriced merchandise you can find cheaper elsewhere; worst it's a scam site trying to steal your info or full of malware.  They have likely deleted evidence of their spamming so you can't see it in their profile. Typically they have multiple alt accounts manipulating the vote and ""thanking"" each other or asking where to get it.  If it looks like a normal comment, it's because they're trying to appear legitimate and build their profile history, but it was probably just copied from elsewhere in this thread or from an x-post ([try here](https://redditsearch.io/?term=""Tennis soccer sounds cool""&dataviz=false&aggs=false&searchtype=comments&search=true&start=0&end=3570664185&size=100&over_18=false)).

**How do I work?** First I read as many new comments as I can and turn each one into a list of noun phrases (things like 'raindrop' or 'brown paper package'). Next I pluralize them and run them through an algorithm to determine the number of syllables each noun phrase contains. If I find that your comment contains three noun phrases of 2 syllables each, one noun phrase of 5 syllables, and one noun phrase of 6 syllables I simply insert them into the lyrics and post them back to you! Finding noun phrases, determining syllables counts, and pluralizing words are all very tricky and I often make mistakes!

he was being fouled on drives and they weren't calling it, plain and simple. if it happens today he starts shooting and bitching but in 2011 he had played the role of villain (which he isn't comfortable being) and just kind of shut down and tried to facilitate.   wade took 15% more shots and got 150% more FTA, bosh took 1% more shots and shot 140% more FTA  lebron's FTA were 2/4/4/4/2/4  his FGA were 16/15/14/11/19/15  he took half his shots inside 10' and actually got most of his FTA on shots OUTSIDE 10' which is fucking weird and has probably never happened to him since  #chalmers got 3 more FTA on half as many shots and he only took 9 shots inside 10'  but someone had to pay the price for the mavs getting fucked in 2006 and who better than the league's newly crowned supervillain  on the other end, lebron got called for 20 fouls, the most on the heat and the 2nd most overall (chandler 24)  it was just a weird series and the only thing he could have done was make bombs. up until that point of his career, he was 31/190 for 16% on deep 3s  after that point he's 85/258 for 33% on deep 3s and that's above the league average (the last 4 years he's become ELITE at long 3s, going 69/179 for 39% which is at the top of the NBA)  he evolved to prevent that scenario from happening again. elite players evolve or they don't stay elite for long.	0

Off the backboard between the legs is objectively better than any dunk in the 88 contest.   Same with a 5’8 player jumping over a 7 footer.   Same with a behind the back dunk.   I can keep going, but the dunks in 88 are ass compared to what the players attempted over the past decade. Not every dunk attempt is a gimmick, and I agree, gimmick dunks are ass. But you’re a dumbass if you think the dunks in 88 are better than what we’ve seen in the past decade. Most of the absolute greatest dunk contest dunks have been in the 00’s and 10’s not the 80’s.	1

Cavs went on to win games 2 and 3 without kyrie and lebron fuelling the fact that dellevadova was the reason curry missed shots and was mocking him.. now curry lit them up in games 4,5 and 6 then he started shouting he didnt have help..Kd only copied what lebron did by going to the warriors.. micheal beat everybody in his path..

Iverson was supposed to get swept too but he made a statement in game 1 by carrying the 76ers top a win with 50 points. Curry only averaged 30 PPG last finals because pf his 47 point outlier, and he only got 47 points because Raptors were up 20 points the whole game so the defense was more relaxed. Every other finals he averaged 21-26 PPG on like 40% FG, there's a reason why he never won Finals MVP. Curry never scored when it mattered, he basically got trash points. Even the last finals when he averaged 30 PPG, Klay was the MVP as he was scoring with efficiency and scored to keep the game close. Curry was shooting them out of the games and then scored when GS was already up, thanks to Klay. Curry had that great 47 point game, but like I said, as great as that performance was, they were never a threat to get the game close so they were basically empty stats. Curry also has other players to take the pressure off of scoring from him and he still is inefficient and can't score when he's called to do it. You're trying to say Iverson never played the level of performance that Steph did in the finals? You're correct, because he was at a different level than Steph. Iverson was the only option and still scored on the Lakers, and that's with Shaq protecting the paint. You're so retarded it's hilarious. Bullshit nostalgia? Nah use your eyes and watch the game. Call a spade a spade when you see it, and the spade is that Curry can't score at will, Iverson can. That's why AI averaged 36 PPG in the finals, more than what Curry has averaged in FIVE finals appearances. That's why AI averaged 28-34 PPG in the regular season even though he was the only option to score and make plays during his prime. In terms of scoring, AI is better than Curry.	0

"Jaylen Brown is the reason I work out. I have this fantasy where we start talking at the Vanity Fair Oscars party bar. We exchange a few pleasantries. He asks what I do. I say I love him on Boston.

I mean, there’s definitely been other bad presidents. I don’t like Trump, but he’s not any worse than the others, he’s just worse at not getting caught. Anyone who works their way to that position is covering some very, VERY sketchy things. He’s just the worst at hiding them. Everyone who has a firm belief in a politician has to overlook things. It’s a matter of what things someone can overlook. Some people can overlook the racism because it lines their pockets. Some people were able to overlook Obama jailing whistle blowers because it furthered their agenda, and people were able to overlook Bush’s non-reaction then subsequent over reaction to 9/11, Clinton getting a hummer, Regan selling weapons against Congress’ wishes and so on, because it furthers their plots. My point is they’re all terrible. Not one single politician is out to help the people. The ones who say they are, are not. If they were, they would be doing something positive with their time and their life instead of driving a wedge into society over partisan politics.  They’re out to make a buck, like we all are. The problem is their dollar comes at the expense of roughly half the people they represent.	0

Read on if you feel called (warning: wall of text). If not then just ignore as you might think I’m throwing propaganda around.  I don’t mean to be insensitive, I only wish to speak the hard truth. Today is a serious reminder that life comes to an end. We are immoral. We can accumulate the world and yet we still leave this earth with nothing. Even Mamba.  I just want to encourage anyone who is dumbstruck, hurt, or confused, to know that there is a God who loves you, and that life truly is fleeting. We are here (quite literally) for a blip of time. There’s way more to life than this short amount of time. Accepting Jesus into your heart changes everything. You begin to have a purpose that’s way bigger than anything here on earth; only because you can take that purpose with you beyond this life. I would love to talk more about my transformation - I’m no perfect Christian, I’m a big sinner, but life has so much more joy and meaning - even in despair like this. Please feel free to reach out if you want to talk more. Even if it’s an educated debate. I’m cool with it.	1

I watch the womens game because you get moments like the one posted above you idiot, i watch the womens game because there is a fuck ton of talent in the women's game that is fun to watch.   The ones gatekeeping basketball are idiots like you who can't go a post on the internet without shitting on anything related to womens basketball while saying a bunch of inaccurate shit about it cause they never actually watch yet they shit on it like they do.	0

The part where you wrote 'his child isn't transitioning' does make it clear, though. Using different pronouns and a different name is absolutely one part of transitioning (though it doesn't necessarily *have* to be), and transitioning does not imply only changes that involve medical or surgical procedures. She's changed her preferred name and asked that she/her be used for her pronouns.  I get where the other reply is coming from, it's not that you're being particularly offensive here but cis people speaking up about what is/isn't appropriate/complicated/acceptable for trans people can be a real sore spot when the opinions of actual trans people are actively being disregarded.	1

>Yeah because Wade is sooo much better at 2s than Harden that's why he misses more shots.   I mentioned 2 specific ways to get 2pt shots. A single percentage that encapsulates the entire area inside the 3pt line isn't telling you how someone scores directly at the rim or in the post.   >Lmao did you ever watch the Heatles? 80% of their offense was iso Wade or LeBron. I remember seeing stats where them and Bosh put up like 90% of the Heats points every year.   Exactly. LeBron AND Wade. He was sharing those duties with another ball dominant player. Not to mention his usage never even touched Harden's over the past 3 years.   >What's not to get? A good portion of Wade's career was just driving to the rack and flopping to go to the line.  It's obvious you don't know what you're talking about lmao. He was able to score out of the PnR, in post ups, from mid range either off a step back or a pull up, he had floaters, and he was a great off ball cutter. Not having a 3pt shot doesn't make someone one dimensional.   >Do you have any actual stats to support Wade is better offensively than Harden?  Obviously not because you're skewed to Harden's last 3 years where the Rockets were running one of the most iso heavy offenses ever.   >Or are you just going to write off all mine with your biased fanboyism?  It's not fanboyism to point out your lack of knowledge.	1

Well considering that his offense fell off a cliff come playoff time, I don't really think those all defensive selections meant much when he could never get out of the first round with the Wolves - barring one year. It's like saying you'd rather have a worse scoring Kawhi Leonard than James Harden. 25ppg on 58TS is so much more valuable in the playoffs than an awful 18ppg on 52TS. Offense is always more impactful than defense. Always.	1

Yao was also a superhuman created by the Chinese government. They bred the tallest woman in China (the Chinese   basketball captain) with one of the tallest men in China (dad was 6'7).  Essentially he was practicing basketball under watch of the government since he was 5. It's some Gattaca shit. They knew he was going to be tall so they basically had him do shooting drills for practice. He came out extremely well rounded as a result, but since humans aren't supposed to grow that tall, his bones couldn't take it. NBA scouts had definitely heard of Yao growing up though, I guarantee it  [Article](https://www.smh.com.au/sport/basketball/yao-ming-the-basketball-giant-made-in-china-by-order-of-the-state-20060119-gdmsz0.html)	0

"ok retard, let me educate you, i pay about 40% (would be less, but im in the highest tax bracket) of my income that includes taxes and MANDATORY social and health insurance which means universities and healthcare is ""free""...so effectively im taxed 40% because i dont have a choice of not paying,its just called 25% tax on income and the rest is divided between social and health insurance - but its all effectively tax, and thats fine i think its a fair system that i also benefit from  i dont know who told you that most have private insurance, probably your retard friends who know as much as you do, so let me explain again its not private insurance, that would imply you have a choice of not being insured - what we have is a MANDATORY insurance governed by private insurance companies  so yeah taxes have a lot to do with healthcare  enjoy trump for another 4 years lmao"	0

Cuomo is still against shutting down business. They deem it okay for me to goto work in a building with 500 plus people. I have a friend who works for my county and they said the state doesn’t plan on shutting down businesses and in acting an active state wide quarantine(you know the only thing that will stop the spread). Also all state workers are allowed to work from home but his office said that temps must stay in state offices if they want to get paid. Again I know someone who started working from home like they were told but later in the day they were forced to come back in. He really isn’t taking it seriously. I called the health services number that the state keeps telling people to call and they said they can’t force anyone to follow the guide lines of the state of emergency and it’s just a suggestion.	0

>Kawhi is a better player than D Wade but he’s not ranked higher historically.   Not yet. But that's mainly because Wade had a 17 year career compared to Kawhi's 9 years. Durant only had 1 less year than Bird.   Durant has the accolades, the longevity, and the stats to compare to Bird. So why can't he be ranked higher?	1

Having over 2 million dollars at 78 when he's worked in the house and Congress for the past 30 years making $174k a year doesn't mean that he's a hypocrite for advocating policies on the extremely wealthy (avg net worth of 70-79 yr olds in this country is 1.1 mil btw) and trying to push policies that benefit the most hard done in society, like his policy isn't that no one should have a million dollars just that people that make over 10 mil a year should pay more taxes and people sitting on billions of dollars should pay a wealth tax bc no one needs that much money. And the 3 houses shit is one of the dumbest talking points around, he inherited one from his dead mom, he owns a house in an inexpensive area that like isn't particularly nice and has a one bedroom apartment in DC that he's needed for his job for the past 30 years lol	0

Duncan robinson is not a rookie. He is a 2nd year player who shot 28% 3pt in his rookie year. Shot 44% from 3pt this year and is averaging 13ppg. Curry averaged 19ppg in his 2nd year and shot 44% so stop hating and appreciate greatness.. it gets a lot harder once u are an established shooter. Im sure duncan robinson may not shoot 30% if he gets to take the kind of shots curry takes. Even iguodala said he can never teach his kid to shoot like curry because its more of a gift than something u can learn. He just has amazing hand eye coordination. Plays pingpong very well, golfs very well. Could play pro golf if he wanted to. Bowls amazingly , throws perfect darts. Im not disputing that someone will one day break his records but he is an amazing talent and your hatred is second to none. Please drop Hakeem's name from your moniker. He is nothing like u are.

"> They had the opportunity to offer him an extension after the season and before free agency. They didn't.  Yeah, and as it clearly states in black and white the reason they didn’t offer a formal extension was because they were aware it wouldn’t make sense for him financially. They didn’t offer the extension because they knew it made more sense to him money-wise to wait for a bigger contract in the summer. Literally right there in English, but I understand reading comprehension isn’t really your strong suit.  In terms of this summer’s free agency, they didn’t offer him a contract because they knew he didn’t want to be there. It isn’t because they didn’t *want* him back. They just understood he’d rather be elsewhere. Not really that difficult to understand.  > Again, you don't know what ""facts"" mean. At all.

 Danny Green’s salary this year is $14,634,147.  Players typically get paid biweekly. The regular season is about 6 months. Danny Green makes a cool half mil every two weeks if paid only during the regular season, or .5mil/month if spread out year round.   I like Danny Green, but damn.  That’s so much money.   That’s over $40k/day.   It’s hard for me to feel a lot of sympathy for him when he makes more money in a day than a solid 1/3 of American households make in a year.    Unless we’re talking G-League-(who make $35k for their 5 month season), these guys should have plenty of money.	0

> Lol if you think there were legitimately no club house issues on the Celtics last year and that anything positive to say about Kyrie isn't anything but diplomacy  Jaylen Brown has straight up come out and said Kyrie gets way too much blame for their problems last season. I’m pretty sure I trust the players who are actually in the locker room more than you.  > Kyrie is so fucking overrated by you idiots it's crazy.   Imagine hurling insults because somebody disagrees with you about a basketball player. How old are you?  Get upset all you want, but you’re the one letting your personal feelings affect your opinion on him as a basketball player. When the players agree with me that Kyrie wasn’t the problem, and the front offices agree with me that they’d rather have Kyrie than DLo, I think it’s fair to say your opinion isn’t a very logical one.  >He joined a team that almost made the finals and they were worse the very next year. But now it's Tatum and Brown's fault.  They almost made the finals because they went up against a far inferior Cavs team. That Celtics team that made the ECF would have gotten destroyed by the Bucks all the same.  It isn’t Tatum and Brown’s “fault”. I’m just pointing out that they’re simply much better players this season compared to last. In addition, Hayward is having his best season since his all star year in Utah. You’re isolating the “Kyrie bad” narrative when in reality basketball is a team game that is affected by more than just one player. If you replace Kyrie with a PG who’s nearly as good, and every other player takes a step forward then no shit they’re going to be a better team.	0

For pretext: I live in Canada. The reported China numbers were scary in February (80K). https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china/   Some countries chose not to act, some chose to take some weak measures (e.g. Canada), then there are countries like Taiwan. If 2-3 countries did a good job (e.g. Taiwan and Singapore), other Countries (especially the 1st world countries) have no excuse.  &nbsp;  In Chinese culture, they work to appease their boss, the yes-man culture. In the COVID-19 case, I do think the suppression started on the state level. A bunch of senior state officials got fired, not low level states people. https://www.businessinsider.com/analysis-china-hubei-officials-sacked-xi-jinping-protected-2020-2 Though this doesn't have to be the case all the time. For example, the milk powder suppression during the Beijing Olympics is on the federal level.   &nbsp;  For your next point, on the suppression causing the initial Wuhan out-break. I agree with this. However, given all the factors that we know today & how infectious this disease is, it would have only slowed the spread.	0

"Honestly I've never gotten that connotation from the use of it if it's used ""correctly"". It's just pointing out that something being said literally sounds gay lol. It isn't homophobic to me at all unless you REALLY go out of your way to use it on things that don't even make sense. Is it kinda lame these days? Sure, but that's a different thing.  I'm not someone who ever really used it, but it's a far cry from saying fag or something."	0

Issue is he said it 13 years ago, in an era where I could call someone a faggot and no one would blink an eye. Doesn’t make sense to judge 2007 LeBron by 2020 standards.

Bro I'm over 40 and don't use IG or Facebook. That's the issue, so many different people who watch games feel the same way and since you're a Stan your comeback is to bring up IG and Facebook.  I didn't see one person let alone analysts that was saying Atlanta or Toronto had a real chance at winning a title or the East. Actually people were bored with the league because everyone already knew who were going to be in the finals. It seems like you are one of these Stan's that tries to push false narratives and then when people don't agree with your fandom you accuse them of not watching games lmfao	0
"I dont think anyone who has the choice between a sink w/ soap and hand sanitizer is arguing hand sanitizer does it better. what IS being argued is when sink w/ soap isnt nearby, sanitizer IS a safe and convenient option to use when 60% alc or more. running down halls or to another building or wherever its obviously not convenient is not good advice when you have a reliable method in hand sanitizer.  shitposting up and down saying ""wash your hands!!!!!"" in response to saying hand sanitizer works on a post about hand sanitizer not working is stupid. if its convenient and right there, wash your hands. If its not convenient and you have hand sanitizer, use a healthy amount and youre fine. if anything opening door handles out of the bathroom that carry germs is far more dangerous to risk than hands free squirts from a bottle that can air dry where you sit. no navigating or grabbing of door handles required at your desk or whatever. neither option is bad, but going out of your way to find a sink w/soap because you refuse hand sanitizer is retarded."	0

Whenever Hakeem defended Shaq he was basically rendered useless, and Hakeem stopped him so many times. Shaq said himself that the way he played against opposing big men was to get in their heads; Hakeem had none of that. Shaw admitted himself Hakeem got in HIS head, not the other way around. If Hakeem was on the Magic, it would’ve at least been a 7 game series. It’s not even like the Rockets cast was that much better than the Magic team. Hakeem dominated the whole series, and there’s a reason the Knicks took him to 7, whereas the Magic got swept. :) Also I dont know why so many of you are dick riding Shaq lmao, this is Shaq before his prime, not in his prime. Smh. And here’s a saying for you: Skill always beats brute force; and hard work beats talent when talent doesnt work hard enough. Hakeem is arguably the most skilled player of all time, and Shaq at the point in his career literally only used brute force. Hakeem outskilled him tremendously.	0

Then like my franchise he continues to deteriorate at a snail's pace with the incompetent fucks he brings in to fix things lacking the wisdom to do anything other than make them worse.  He's lived a lavish lifestyle of gluttony and greed, spent more money without a second thought on whether he could afford it than any of us put together will likely ever earn in our lifetimes and treated his workers like he treats the team he owns, like trash  If this virus is going to take so many undeserving then it better take at least one person that does, and I can think of parasite on God's green Earth more deserving than James fucking Dolan  Edit: Hahahaha 13 MINUTES LATER I GOT THE BAN, THAT'S GOTTA BE SOME SORT OF RECORD	0

If LeBron handpicked his teammates he could have picked a hell of a lot better ones. He could’ve joined much better teams than the lakers.   LeBron doesn’t have full control over who gets signed. That’s absurd. He has input sure, but he’s not hand picking who is signed or who teams draft.   And if my aunt had a dick she would be my uncle. Players make fucking shots. That happens. LeBron scored 16 that quarter btw. Which you ignorant fools like to ignore.   Sure let’s say the cavs lose in 2016. Give me all of my hypotheticals and LeBron has a hell of a lot more than 3 rings.   Ray Allen is a hypothetical because he didn’t miss.   I never mentioned 2011 as that is obviously a stain on his legacy.   No one is removing him of blame you numb nuts. We just actually have a brain and use it to provide context.	0

You shouldn't believe anything. Don't believe propaganda or illogical media telling you what to believe. There are enough whistleblowers out there saying covid is being marked on patients that died who clearly did not have it that you should at least use common sense to doubt what you are being told.  What were we told at first? MILLIONS COULD DIE. 65m Americans might die.  They have to falsify literally every person in ICU that they can, and the numbers are still pathetically low lol.  I'd be all over the hate Gobert bandwagon, if this was actually the plague or something. Right now this all seems ridiculously fishy, and no one will probably have a clue what the truth is.  Maybe they are doing it to reset the economy, to gather data about the environment, et cetera. And maybe they are just grabbing more power. Nobody knows. What we do know is that covid is not even close to what the fearmongers were saying, and there are multiple studies out there that say staying at home, with so many exceptions like we are now, doesn't even help.	0

Damn. This is no joke.  Idc I truly believe gobert needs to be hit with charges for the way he acted.   All I learned from the NBA is that it's fine to act like an uneducated retard and you will slide under the charges because of your privilege, even if you are risking killing people  Dumb people need to be shamed publicly and since he has a decent salary, he should be hit hard financially to get a message sent. Somebody like him won't register wrongdoing unless he gets thrown in jail for a few months, cut from the team. And then his money fucked with.  Fuck this guy he also infected his teammate donovan mitchell who is way more valuable, and all around more intelligent than Rudy gobert.  First bending over for China over protest criticism...

but you did remember something and extrapolated my entire comment type based on?   I don't even talk about curry much, you can't even deny you spend all day talking shit about bron. All your comments from today support that.   maybe don't call people bandwagoners when you bandwagon a player. . A player on the NBAs most recent dynasty too.  Talking about pathetic when you do that. Talking about bronsexuals when you're a currysexual. Get what I mean? You're complaining about the very thing you are. Literally every insult you aim at bron fans get be applied to you with curry.   I like bron, but I wasn't cheering for him when he faced my team. I started watching ball a decade ago because of bron so that's why I'm a fan of his. But his success doesn't mean shit for my city. People like you don't understand that. If curry leaves you'll just follow him there. Same for bron fans	0

> because no number I’ll ever say will change your mind  Because you've already clearly laid out you have no idea what a vertical is or how it's measured.    > that's not how we determine vertical because you're not standing perfectly upright like you are when we measure standing reach. You lean your body back when you're jumping from a running start, that's where the other 2 inches go  Yeah that's all complete bullshit.  NFL, NBA, college basketball, it's all measured the same way.   Someone stands on the ground, touches the highest point they can.  Then they jump and touch the highest point they can.  The difference is your vert.  It's as simple as it gets, the only differences is now they use a vertec, which just sets the measurement at the right height for the player but it's the same principle.   > it's almost like there's a reason we don't use standing reach to determine vertical. I'm not sure if you know this, but when you jump from a running start, your body isn't 100% upright.  Just blatantly wrong.  How are you arguing this?  [You realize there's a ton of video from NBA and NFL combines, right?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMz1CKMOLr4)  > can literally see his feet that far off the ground in the video  No one can be this dumb^.  You don't measure a vertical from the ground because legs aren't straight in the air.  I didn't jump higher just because I bent my knees more.  > Unless you have another source I’m gonna go ahead and trust the multiple measurements that have been done.   What multiple measurements?  We have his standing reach, the only other number we need is max reach.  In the video they said that was 12' 4.5 inches.  Please link me anywhere else his vertical was measured.	1

There already was a reign of terror, but it was a slow and dispassionate one. And with Trump's plans to sacrifice even more people for the sake of the stock market yet more terror is to come. Which terror would you accept: the quick one that ends suffering or the long one that prolongs it? I wish we could do this without suffering, but I feel that if we could've convinced the powerful to do the right thing, they would've done it already. Instead, they are eager for more blood to be shed in the name of the market.	0

And with that comment, you’ve either ousted yourself as a troll, or completely inept. LeBron is, quite simply, the greatest all-around athlete to ever step on a basketball court.

"Weak East??  The Cavs sweep the Washington Wizards. Despite Arenas being hurt, that year Caron Butler was all star, and prime Antawn Jamison (20/8 machine being a good shooter even playing the 4)  Won in 6 against prime Vince Carter, prime Jason Kidd and prime Richard Jefferson. Let that sink for a few seconds.   Defeated in 6 the Detroit Pistons... Chris Webber, Antonio Mcdyess, Tayshaun Prince, Rasheed Wallace and Chauncey Billups with one of the best playoffs performances ever, scoring. 29 of the last 30 points of his team against the 2nd best defense in the league.   Weak East...  LeBron averaged 25/8/8 with 2 steals with one of the slowest pace teams in the playoffs.  His second best teammate was Larry Hughes... 11 points per game on 34% shooting. And Ilgauskas, 12/9  And evidently, they lose against prime Duncan, prime Manu and prime Parker (MVP of the finals). That Spurs team had the best coach ever or one of the best in Pops, Defensive especialist Bowen and good and experienced players like Michael Finley Robert Horry.  To put you all in perspective, Michael Finley had the same numbers with better % than Larry Hughes (in theory LeBron's best teammate)   Because I am an old fan and I don't forget.  The Cavs signed Larry Hughes after his best year and Donyell Marshall and people were talking about a ""big 3"". Well... LeBron's supposedly co-star impacted the game same as the Spurs 4th best player..  All of this while playing 45 minutes per game those playoffs"	1

Andre was a walking shadow.. nobody could score.  Curry scored 47 in game 3 and  the next highest scorer dropped 10pts.. andre dropped a whopping 3points in 38mins in game 3.. They would have lost game 7 and maybe someone else gets hurt..	0

"Anfernee Simons is a young guy for whom many had high hopes, but has underperformed this season. At one point in the season, he was the first guard off the bench, but this place has been taken by Gary Trent, who has shown much better shooting and defense for the TrailBlazers. Coach Stotts has taken to staggering Dame and CJ's minutes rather than rely on this rather raw PG to run the offense.  But before we give up on him, there are three things to remember. First, he is very, very young for a second year player. He's only 20, but looks about 16. Secondly, he is physically gifted with great ""hops"" and sufficient quickness. And finally, he is playing behind a couple of the best, most cerebral PGs in the league, players who are known for their intelligence and willingness to help others achieve.  Of course, playing behind Dame and CJ could retard his development as well. He has never really been called to be ""the Man"" except for one unusual game at the end of last season. But if you are looking for someone with high potential but has been written off lately, you could do worse than taking a flyer on Anfernee."	1
The extent of the arguments I’ve seen in this thread are “you’re just salty” “but they talked trash tho” “but Nurkic tho” etc. The point still remains that it makes zero sense to get on a player for playing badly in a playoff series while they were injured in a way that would clearly affect their level of play (mainly in Westbrook’s case, PG to a lesser extent) unless you just dislike them. If you can’t see that then you’re honestly just delusional.	0
I want you to think about the last time you were actually happy or actually had a friend.  Now then, since you can't and don't have a friend, go outside tomorrow and make one. Its way better than using a second troll account and wasting your time saying shit you don't have the balls to say IRL anyway ;)	0

Barnes is also not (to quote Chris Rock) a retarded person that can talk, I don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone say a white person is “well-spoken” and sounds like a backhanded compliment	0

"Oh come on, the comment I responded to about funding for military but not for health is obviously a jab at conservative spending in general, healthcare (either socialized or ACA), or the CDC budget (or even all three). I then try as hard as possible to limit the scope of the argument to my point, that funding had not been cut (which it hasn't), then get told I'm wrong (which I'm not) while being told I'm straw-manning (how?).  I feel like most people think the response has been poor, but [Democrats literally wanted Trump to end the travel ban and thought it was overreaching](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/11/democrat-response-to-coronavirus-end-trumps-travel-bans-on-china-iran/) and [called it racist](https://www.wnd.com/2020/02/democrats-call-trumps-expansion-travel-ban-racist/), while actively trying to resist it. Coronavirus hasn't gotten anywhere as bad as H1N1 yet and I don't think depression-inducing panic is going to solve anything. Neither does appealing to some moral authority and politicizing a topic where, you personally should want good leadership and a calm attitude.  Trump has already tried to appropriately seek funding meanwhile Nancy Pelosi had the United States senate on lock from the middle of January into February, and then again when a coronavirus bill was trying to be passed she tried to sneak in a Hyde amendment exception [source](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/sasse-rips-pelosi-for-trying-to-smuggle-hyde-amendment-loophole-into-coronavirus-package/). If the response has been ""poor"" both sides are to blame."	0
I mean I pretty much agree with what you said, I wasn’t offended by it (and I’m not gay). And I have friends who say the same shit, but usually someone will be like “c’mmon man”, or something like that. I honestly probably wouldn’t even say anything, I just choose not to say those kind of jokes (kind of like calling things ‘retarded’ or ‘gay’).   But anyway yea I don’t think it makes you a terrible person or anything for saying it, just that it’s not something I would defend someone else for saying and I get why some ppl dont like it.	1

There's 14 players in the HoF that have scored less than Bosh while shooting more shots than him. What's your excuse for that?	1
He's been amazing this year.	1
1) Basketball is inherently a star-driven sport. 5 guys on the court, 1 player can have a significant enough impact to win the game himself, usually by scoring a lot. 22 players on a football field, and look at who are the most popular, QB’s/WR’s/RB’s, the guys that do the scoring.  2) Football players wear helmets covering their face. Basketball players have their faces shown all the time.  3) Basketball is an international sport, basically just a numbers game at that point in terms of followers. I would reckon that soccer players have more IG followers than American football too.	0
On that 2014 SAS team, Kawhi's numbers on that team were among the best while having a top defensive level responsibility. There's no shame for his stats being weighed down when he performed at the highest level.	0

">all people making these comments about a players likeness are gay  No but I don't care either way. You can be straight and admire handsome men  >2) all these comments are humorous and not somewhat irritating and potentially hurtful  Can you explain how they're hurtful? I never got that impression.  (Except the dwight stuff).  Sure it's not always funny. I've rarely if ever been offended or hurt. Again, can only speak for me.  >3) no ""gay people"" are offended by constantly mocking their sexuality  There's a fine line. The Dwight stuff reaaaaally crossed it for me but I'm a hypocrite and cracked a joke or two. I felt bad reading through that thread though. Dwight didn't deserve that and that's really the only time here I felt like gayness was callously the butt of the joke.  >4) my comment is aimed at you if you aren't even trying to mock/make fun of/dehumanize these athletes, their sexual preferences and their look   You mean isn't?"	1
"If you were saying the latter then why do you keep sticking by the former? I dont even care for you to change your stance but you should recognize your tone and that words have meaning. If you want to say they are within their grounds to take it down then you're right. If you want to say iyo they should have already taken it down, awesome. But when you say that ""legally speaking they should have taken it down"" and lol at ppl for not knowing trademark law...c'mon. Dont you see how that comes across? Why not just take the step back to not act like an expert?"	1

Ikr, too many people have been sleeping on Rui. He’s been one of the most consistent rookies this season, behind only Morant and maybe Zion. He’s been putting up solid numbers and is contributing significantly to the Wizards on both ends. You really gonna ignore greatness just because its in Washington?	0
lol him throwing immature temper tantrums doesn’t mean he has kobe mentality	1
with all due respect, if you yourself acknowledge you haven't done any research on the topic, maybe you should just listen when people who have read the research that other people *have* done are talking about it?   there are potential side effects that may impact fertility and bone density, but for the majority of trans people ive ever spoken with the consensus opinion is that it's absolutely well worth those slight and rare risks compared to struggling with gender dysphoria that can be heavily intensified by changes brought on by puberty, most of which would require a lot more work to reverse or modify surgically after they have already occurred (if the individual decides to transition later in life)	1

Lol you retards really don’t understand economics at all. The “economy” is the sum of a society’s transactions. No transactions means no money in the hands of many. Money becomes meaningless if it’s not distributed. Products stop being produced since their is no profit incentive. You thought people were hoarding TP now? Wait until it’s stop being produced at all and now it’s a game of who has a gun. By the way medical facilities are gonna be 20x more over run when people don’t have access to basic products and nutrition. But let’s just stay inside for 3 years until this blows over those retard republicans are too concerned with society collapsing dumb Fox News hicks	0

"Oh yeah, the guy whose nickname is ""The Big Round Mound of Rebound"" was weak on the boards. Sure. Believe that. Just like nobody who has ever been posterized is a good rim protector.

That might make more sense, if you're the type who uses thought and reason to form conclusions."	0

I can't speak for everyone but honestly the more people overplay the situation the more inclined I am to believe it's blown out of proportion. That's not to say it's not serious, just not as serious as everyone is blowing it up to be.	1
Curry without even blinking. People look at cp3's assists and say he is a better facilitator but i believe curry is a better facilitator who doesnt care about personal stats. Warriors offense run by curry generates the highest number of assists. If u count curry's hockey assists u will realise his playmaking skills is beyond what the score sheet reflects. A PG should be able to make his team mates better and curry has done exactly that.. if draymond was playing with CP3 would he ever be an all star?. Why is it that almost all cp3's ex team mates hate him. I heard stories that he passes the ball to teammates with the shot clock winding down to avoid taking the turnover..Curry has no issue with team mates and coaches which is even as important in winning as on court plays.. more efficient scorer, great facilitator, great team mate.. Curry all day	0

First positive thing I’ve heard about Dolan	0
Obama and Trump have not caused the deaths of anywhere near as many people as Bush did. Libya, the drone program, and the typical coups that Obama backed were all awful and Trump is loose cannon, who seems ready at any minute to start a genocide of brown people. However, from a foreign policy stand point alone Bush and his entire administration deserve to be hanged at the Hague. The comparison isn't even close. He started a war that killed nearly a million people that he justified with evidence he knew was fraudulent explicitly to gain access to Iraq's oil reserves. Reserves that he wound up handing over to the Chinese when it was all said and done. Every person to die as result of warfare in Iraq since 2003 has died because Bush was willing to lie to Congress, the UN, the courts, and America at large to get his rich buddies even richer.  Trump is pure evil, I'd say one of the most despicable men to ever hold the office. But his incredible capacity for evil lacks the resume that Bush's did. Bush is by far the most destructive and morally bankrupt man to hold the presidency in my lifetime, and probably yours too.	1

You didn't. I didn't.   But we aren't rape trial fans. We are basketball fans. And at the end of the day whatever happened in CO doesn't affect how good a basketball player he is and how transcendent that was- and quite honestly how transcendent a person he was in every other moment of his life.   People care about basketball. I mean Derrick Rose is literally stupid. And has made immoral choices in college and with women, people don't care at all.	0
Doesnt surprise me this sub is ran like a fucking nazi camp	1
I can’t believe some of y’all are saying no lol. The best 8th grade players are taller than most adults and are obviously infinitely better at basketball than someone who’s never played  So much of the game is instincts and BBIQ, that wouldn’t be close either	0

This is complete nonsense because the cdc isn’t lagging one week behind. The simple fact of the matter is that if you looked at any of the stats on coronavirus testing in the USA practically nobody was getting tested despite showing symptoms for the longest time.   Sk was testing even mild symptoms from the beginning and was tracking every single infected and doing targeted testing.   The USA has limited its testing to only those who are seriously ill and have known contact to a previously infected person. But if they haven’t been testing for infected people, then this dumbass attempt at testing based on known personal connections to a sick person has basically crippled any testing results the USA had in the past. Even if they catch up with testing 50k a day from today onwards it’s likely due to the exponential growth nature of the virus that the USA will be significant worse off than skorea and given the fact that Americans of younger ages have more comorbidities due to obesity related health issues, the USA is going to be much much worse off.  Italy is going to be a pisstake compared to the USA when the stats finally catch up after 2 weeks of 50k plus testing and overburdened hospitals.	0

You're stupid. If it wasn't for entrepreneurs throughout history productivity would have mostly stagnated. These people are the reason why the common man actually has this high standard of living. It's not as if this is all given and the billionaires were the ones to steal from what was given. They created this wealth because the system incentivizes this. Not saying that the proportion of those incentives arent misaligned, but to say that they steal something is just stupid.	0

Man this is overstated. Yes it's 'rape' according to law but when you grow up in the 80s and 90s you saw college dudes banging teenagers left and right. Celebrities did this all the time. That's why it's a bigger deal now than it was 20 years ago. I am not saying Malone isn't a dick, he definitely is the way he trested his children. But it's disningenuous to view him as the kind of rapist that ignored consensual agreement. Though ironically no one brings that up qhen talking about Kobe.	0

I work at a hospital and can attest that it has been a ghost town, was far busier in January, and that this is all smoke and absolutely no fire.   In official hospital emails they are even admitting that “test results are not reliable.”  I don’t know what they’re testing for but based on my research it seems to show up in some percentage of all subjects anyway, or maybe even vestigial from a prior flu vaccination.   But one thing is certain, there are only “test results” and rumors thereof; there is no actual deadly outbreak occurring and we are being forced participants in a worldwide drill that we didn’t sign up for.	0

Go look at Kawhis 4th quarter stats from each of the games in the 2019 finals.  Game 1 - 1 for 2 FGs  Game 2 - 1 for 6 FGs  Game 3 - 3 for 4 FGs  Game 4 - 1 for 2 FGs  Game 5 - 5 for 12 FGs   Game 6 (Closeout Game) - 0 for 4 FGs - 0 rebounds - 0 assists - 0 blocks - 0 steals.  Kawhi was pretty non existent in a lot of these 4th quarters. The closeout game he was pretty atrocious. We just don’t remember or care because his name isn’t Lebron. Can you imagine if Lebron had that stat line to close out a finals and his team won anyways? People still give Lebron shit over the Kyrie shot, even tho Lebron outscored him 11 to 5 and shot a better % in that quarter. VanVleet has 12, Siakem had 5 points, as many as Kyrie had.. and yet not a single person ever mentions it.   I’m not saying he can’t close, but he’s not this god level closer people pretend he is.	1
Seemingly a lot more suburban kids are in the NBA now outside of just kids of ex pros. Didn’t used to be as common. Also many more foreign players from all backgrounds   But anyway AAU is the same collective scam The NCAA runs but at high school level. It’s really picked up a ton the last 2 decades. They do events sponsored out the ass by the biggest shoe companies and invite x amount of heralded kids or teams for any given event and do it strenuously enough that many American prospects are known for a long time.   Many of the kids are stars while still in high school now so they have crazy media coverage themselves, it’s not a rare thing like when Lebron was in HS  The only players you can’t account for are late bloomers which are pretty common in the NBA, and then all the foreign players in the league now too (outside of the obvious lottery picks) that you can’t scout as extensively (Jokic and Giannis for example )	0

Not at all. There's good reason we don't utilize an overall popular vote, middle America wouldn't have their voices heard. It's just that those markets usually A. Have more people per capita than the vast majority of the country and B. Aren't diverse politically.  In fairness half of the country doesn't vote so we can't for sure say one way or the other.  Biden is now unpopular? The entire party is backing him and he'll be more competitive in the south and blue collar states than Hillary and certainly Bernie. Maybe unpopular amongst Millennials but not in general."	0

"He's portraying a situation in which the homophobia affecting the NBA disproportionately originates from POCs. This may or may not be true.  I'm pointing out that many white people are also homophobic, and I'm asserting that religion is the most common thread for homophobes, not ""un-whiteness"".   I don't necessarily see the value of, for example, lumping Chinese Buddhist fans in with Catholic Latino fans as ""the POC population"" while ignoring evangelical whites who, believe it or not, *do* watch the NBA.  I just don't think the way he dissected it is necessarily the most reasonable way to do so."	1

"In retrospect, when I look back I realize my parents raised me very well. However, when I was a kid, I thought the opposite. My parents gave me so much advice that I started tuning it out. I 100% would've listen to a celebrity I looked up to's social media post more than my parents. Kids on the cusp of puberty and teenagers are simply hardwired to be rebellious, they listen to people who they think are ""cool"" instead of their parents. There are literally countless books, movies, and real anecdotes about kids and teenagers refusing to listen to their parents, about following what the ""cool"" people do, it's just what happens.  You clearly do not have any children over the age of 10 if you think kids not listening to their parents are a result of them not being raised properly.

Because you're equating regular season stats with finals. It's disingenuous to assume a player will replicate their regular season stats in the playoffs and especially the Finals. He averaged 24 his first MVP season so your point is garbage anyway.   Curry has always been a high turnover player. Him playing recklessly is what makes his game a huge tradeoff between explosive plays and devastating mistakes. Calling that out as if it's a singular event is also disingenuous.   Lastly, assists are only counted if the player makes the shot. Using that as a metric without looking at how bad everyone else played is also nonsense. Go back and watch how many open shots were whiffed by Barnes, Iggy, and Thompson.   Everyone played down. Curry wasn't great, but saying he massively choked is a straight up delusional argument. You're looking for some kind of legitimate excuse to hate on him when the truth is there isn't really. This is painfully obvious by the fact your initial reasoning for hating on Curry is that he threw his mouthpiece. If you want to hate, go ahead. But don't act like your reasons come from anything based in reality.	0

"Why would the ruling class of bankers and warmongers willfully put a cap on their own wealth? Why would the ruling class of billionaires willfully split up big business against their interests? Capitalism is when the ruling class of wealthy ""capitalists"" own private property and use their government to protect their interests. Capitalism is when the government steals workers' taxes to bailout Wall Street. That is unconditionally not socialism.   So you're actually advocating that workers become the ruling class, because there is no other way to exert such a cap on wealth, which means you're actually arguing for socialism, which means we need to forcefully seize land and factories and distribution networks while abolishing IP. It's good to feel this way but now it's time to stop expecting capitalism to just be better and start to study Marx and working class history"	0

When Harden goes off he takes a hell of a lot more scoring possessions than other superstars.

A.) The 'average voter' doesn't understand things like federal monetary policy either, does that somehow mean it isn't fucking important?      B.) China and CCP are different things. I'm not sure you actually understand that the CCP is the political party that rules one of the two countries called 'China'.      C.) Even if you are aware of B, separation must always be drawn between a people and their government. Idk which side of the political spectrum you're on (assuming you're from the USA), but do you want to be closely identified with whatever stupid decisions Obama / Trump have made? Was it your decision to go to war in Afghanistan & Iraq? Were you responsible for the lax policy that lead to the current rapid spread of Covid 19 in the US?  No, it was your government.	0

Or imagine watching someone do it live!  It's much different than simply sitting there watching your friend play. Just got to find the right streamers.  In a different way of putting it, imagine you watching your friends play basketball. You're going to want to play with them right? Now imagine instead you come to the court and Lebron is playing MJ one on one. I know I'd love to see that.  Now replace that with you watching your favorite game being played by someone at the top of the leaderboard.	0

"> “they [Europeans] just learn how to play basketball while our guys [Americans] learn how to dunk and put together mixtapes.”  This is only racist if you want to think of it that way, but ignoring race altogether this statement is not wrong **if you generalize** which Cuban did  AAU basketball has definitely turned us into a culture of running and dunking. This is not racist. Mac McClung was a phenom on the highlight circuit because of his dunking ability and he's white. I can show you lists of other playlists of these 5 star prospects running and dunking. That's not seen in europe like it is here, and no this isn't racist this is just factua. The big name high school players are the ones running and dunking in AAU ball   ON the contrary overseas players are frequently seen as being 'skilled' more often than american players. Sure there are exceptons but look at most european big men"": they are great passers, they shoot free throws well, and they have overall basketball savviness. The Gasols, Jokic, Sabonis, Vucevic, it goes on and on. This is not seen as much as it is in American centers. How many american born centers do you see with this craftiness? Obviously they have these skills to *some* degree but in European players they tend to show better basketball 'skills' than do the likes of Drummond, Dedmon, Whiteside, Okafor, Howard, McGee   you are trying too hard to make it a race issue"	1

Any time a player scores a high volume of points, there are going to be plenty of fouls. If you go back to Wilt Chamberlain's 100 point night, he got 32 foul shots and made 28 (really good, especially for a person that was around 50% from the charity stripe).   But it is also said that Wilt's teammates kept fouling the other team, so they could get the ball back and allow Wilt to get to 100. I think if you are going to put an asterisk on Devin's 70 point night based on your argument, then there should be an asterisk on Wilt's 100 point performance.	0

First, I remember healthcare prior to Obama. You're right that healthcare has been free market in America for a long time. But never before has it been so closely tied to employment where almost all large employers are forced to provide healthcare for full time employees. It fucked up a lot of people's lives and is part of why so many people have to have two jobs now.  At a place I managed we used to have full time hourly employees just out of high school. But with Obamacare we cut all their hours to less than 28 per week to avoid having to provide healthcare for them.   Any full time employees and their employers immediately starting paying premiums for ALL employees. This immediately added billions of dollars in premiums to the corporations controlling health insurance.  It also forced many companies to cut hours so much that people who were making a living before were completely screwed.  And a healthy person used to be able to choose rather they wanted to pay out of pocket for a yearly checkup or pay for insurance. It's cheaper to just pay out of pocket for one yearly visit if you are lucky enough to stay healthy.   Health insurance is supposed to be used for risk mitigation. If you're low risk then why should you be forced to pay exorbitant premiums???   Plus, those premiums are not on a case by case basis. If they were healthy young 20 year old would pay very little in insurance costs. As it is young employees on a company provided healthcare plan pay the same as a 40 year old or 50 year old employee, meaning they're paying for some of the burden and risk of the older employees with no choice to drop out.  Not to mention how many services aren't covered by insurance plans and how insane your deductibles can be. On many you have to pay 5k out of pocket for hospital services before anything is even covered by the plan you pay for, and thats assuming you are in the right network and seen by the right doctors and the procedures are ultimately deemed necessary and are covered by the insurance company and plan you have.  Second, your second paragraph agrees with what I said.   But I think our healthcare costs are artificially propped up partially because there is no mediator. The government providing healthcare would allow them to leverage mass purchasing of supplies and medicine and also control market costs of critical medical supplies.  This extrapolates the previous problem even further because so many people were forced into paying for health insurance in the new system and with the costs being outrageously high it multiplies the profit margins of those corporations.  This is asinine.	0

Crazy thing is Lebron is built stronger physicallly than he's ever been but he has lost a bit of his explosiveness. But even when they played head to head in March, it was clear Giannis had an issue with Lebron's strength when they bumped bodies and that almost never happens to Giannis.	0

Sure I’ll explain. I think the first thing is that bin laden intentionally killed those people through action and trump on the other hand caused more deaths through inaction. Bin Laden made a willful choice to commit those acts. Trump on the other hand didn’t try to kill people he just is an idiot and thought this was just the flu or whatever it is that he thought. I think there’s a big difference between intentional murder and inaction due to ignorance. Almost every president at some point makes decisions that cost lives. I don’t think this means they can be equated to murderers. And I don’t think this means they deserve death..... but just to be clear I really dislike trump and this he’s an idiot and a terrible leader. Just don’t want him to die because of it.	0
Meanwhile President Trump:  * Hasn't donated anything (edit: he did donate his q4 salary) * Was with at least one person last week who is confirmed to have the virus * Is trying to convince Americans a miracle will make all of this go away very soon * Pretty much refuses to get tested even after knowing he's been exposed * Was caught shaking hands of Whitehouse staff within the past 24 hrs on camera * Touched the microphone he used to deliver an address about the pandemic 31 times  The overreaction to Rudy exposes people for their under-reaction to this complete joke of a 'world leader'... so yeah.  Edit: a quarter of his annual salary is great and I’m not in a position to judge one way or the other, but Rudy’s donation is still significantly larger and he doesn’t run a mutli-million dollar corporation, just saying	1

This is ridiculous.   Kevin Garnett would talk about your wife, parents getting cancer, people dying.   Kobe Bryant called a ref a fag on national television, cheated on his wife and settled a sexual assault case. He made it up to her with a an 8 million dollar diamond ring.  There are other players that literally tried to kill their coach (Sprewell) that don't get as much shit as D Wade does. Dude has some bad on-court moments but what he has done for representation of fathers, black fathers, gay, trans, and all he has done for Chicago, Miami, and some specific people should far outweigh that.	0

While the rape allegations are definitely a bad light, I at least speak for myself when I say that I truly think Kobe was a champion for women. He was one of the few NBA players that actually went to and supported women's basketball games. He respected game regardless of gender. He just wanted to see people hoop.   He was passionate about his daughter's basketball ability and wasn't saddened to not have sons. He became an incredible ambassador for women's basketball.	1

They shit on LeBron any chance they get, shit on the Celtics and whine and fight with every other fanbase. Fuck, here in Toronto, there were so many bandwagon Laker fans/Kobe fans who weren't true to the raptors it was annoying as fuck.  Then they became those annoying warriors bandwagons in 2015 who continue to shit on LeBron.  Where do you see these so called ""annoying LeBron fans""? If they shit on Curry or KD it's only because those fans are attacking him like they have for the past 10 years."	0

In the 60s there were 8 teams so Wilt and Russel had to go up against a Hall of Famer almost every night. Many of the guys playing back then were legends, and its mighty disrespectful to say they weren't. Also I don't care what era youre in, Bill Russell has a ring for every single finger, and his dick for christs sake! Wilt averaged 50 for an entire season. Wilt averaged 39 ppg thru 7 seasons. Thats fucking batshit. Russell is 21-0 in elimination games. Without him, on two seperate occasions his teams went on losing streaks when he was injured, so you cant say he just had a good team. Listen, I dont mean to insult you, but perhaps you should go watch some of their actual games before spouting out nonsense youve been hearing in the echo chamber that we call reddit.   Sorry if i got a little carried away. Imo russell and wilt are at least top 5 all time.	0

I don't get why people think guy is some lowkey douche. I remember watching a player tribune video and guy seemed like a very well-spoken and geniune dude. Maybe he has faults and could seem immature but it doesn't seem he is some POS person. It's why I laugh at the arrogant Jimmy Butler fanboys thinking KAT is not some good hearted person. I really feel bad for his loss man.    I'm done with people being entitled in America. It's not just about taking things seriosuly but just understnading the situation. Many people complain about how much these lockdowns are hurting many people and I aree. We can't expect to lockdown America for so long, but we need to get people hve already and can be affected by this and it's not good. It's why I wish people just stopped panicking like the babies in r/coronovirus making everything seemed like the end of the world and people at /unpopularopinion saying this virus is a joke and that everything should cater ot people who won't bve affected and going to malllies and getting dollies for my baby girl is more important. Hey consevrtive go FUCK YOURSELF. I don't care if KAT is a celebrity, his mother fuckin died and seemed like a average American. Fuck America at times. Hope people just take things seriosuly and just look towards getting things done SOON. We could possibly get this under control, we should always have faith. The season can literally restart in 2020. But just do THINGS NOW.	0

Lebrons teammates screwed him SO HARD at the end of that game. Here’s the final play made by every starter besides Lebron.  Kevin Love - On the play before the Hill free throws the Cavs are winning by 2. Kevin Love makes one of the most disgusting soft fouls ever. Probably the worst foul committed in the history of the Cavs franchise, given what it meant. Steph gets an EASY and 1 to put them up by 1. This foul was literally just as bad as the Ginobili v Dirk foul but nobody remembers it because of what else happened.  George Hill - next play Hill misses the FT. Now I’m not too mad about this because that’s fucking hard to do, making both free throws in that situation. Idc if it’s MJ, KD, Dirk, or anyone in between. Hitting free throws at the end of a finals game is Not easy. That being said he’s still an 80% FT shooter who missed.  JR Smith - didn’t know the score of the game somehow,, and then lied about it, also tried to point the finger at Lebron.  Tristan - tried to start a fight with Draymond  If Lebron didn’t know he was leaving,he knew after that. Literally every starter besides him did something retarded to end that game.	0

"He's taking what the guy said in the top comment - ""ITT a bunch of people who have never hooped"" - and ratcheting it up to 11.  Nothing in his comment is even talking about fouling.  It's just laughably stereotypical blustering about how great he was in high school.  And that's the point.  He's mocking the original top comment by saying things like ""their's such a big disconnect between myself and your typical redditor"" - because that's what the original top commenter is essentially doing: creating a disconnect between himself and those ""ITT who have have never hooped""  It's a caricature of *that guy who peaked in high school and always brings up that one big game to try and impress people years later*.  That's also why he said ""only to get fucked over by the refs in the 4th""...it's a reference to the 'ole ""[Man if only coach had put me in we would have won the championship](https://aleteia.org/blogs/catholic-thinking/dont-be-uncle-rico-a-moral-snatched-from-napoleon-dynamite/)"":  >I’m dead serious…How much you wanna make a bet I can throw a football over them mountains?… Yeah… If Coach woulda put me in fourth quarter, we would’ve been state champions  No one is being given the nickname ""speedhawk"" lmao.  And when he says *why* his coaches called him that, it's because he had ""such a nose for basketball"", which has nothing to do with speed.    It's a satirical comment in the same vein as the ""Navy Seal 300 confirmed kills"" or ""To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand..."" copypastas.  Also it's literally just a /r/nfl [copypasta](https://old.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/e3ovc9/speedhawk/):  >Am I the only one in this sub who's actually played organized tackle football before?  >Like half of the comments I've seen on this sub are so obviously written by non-athletes that it's almost humorous.  >When I was in high school (3 year starter for our varsity football team) I would get a full-on sprint going and clock the shit outta whoever had the ball. My coaches called me ""speedhawk"" as a nickname caus I had such a nose for the football and for those three seasons I was considered the most feared safety in our conference. Senior year I led my team to the state semifinals only to get fucked over by the refs in the 4th but that's another conversation (DM me if you're interested in hearing about it)  >So, yeah.

I think you’re underestimating how bad things really were at the time for them to do that and with the new era of social media, sports, Netflix and drugs being easy for people to get if they want people are always able to distract from wider issues that don’t directly affect them. Back then they were literally starving to death it would take something like that for a revolution to happen it would have to be a significant amount of the population literally on the brink of dying before this would happen.   There’s also the fact that despite its glorification the French Revolution didn’t really help things that much while they had some great ideas they also decided to execute anyone who disagreed with them or if they were just religious and it lead to lots of people just trying to gain more power for themselves. It wasn’t French Revolution happened and then the monarchy never came back and everything was good there were like 4 French Revolutions and lots of government changes and deaths.	0

Meh I did the math on the wrong year. But tbh I really dont care that harden got roughly 100 more points for the season in an era where scoring is drastically higher than it was in wilts era. Also what did harden win that year? Oh yea an all nba selection. That's it. No mvp. No chip. According to analysts he wasnt even the best player in the nba that year, much less had a better season than the GOAT center...long story short. Harden is not even close to the most valuable player in the nba currently, much less the best ever...go homer him some more, maybe make like a beard subreddit or something so you can go jerk off in a circle with all the other guys that like watching the pace of a game where one player takes 30 free throws.	1

"He is smart. But he gets caught up in pseudoscience from time to time, and has a tendency to state things as fact that simply are not. And occasionally, such as in Talking With Strangers, says rather... atrocious things. Specifically, when he talks about the relationship between alcohol and rape. It is a very, very uncomfortable read. In the book ""Blink"" he basically espouses mind reading in various parts.   He's a very bright guy, but he loves to play to the new age-y nonsense crowd. He has some legitimate ideas, and he does a good job popularizing a number of social science ideas, it's just interlaced with bullshit. Which makes it kind of super frustrating.  So yeah, you didn't get the wrong impression of him. He's just got a lot of problems, and shouldn't really be taken at face value. He LOVES to speak about things as known or concrete even when the evidence is flimsy at best.   But again, he also popularizes a lot of things, and gets people interested in social science stuff to begin with, which has its benefits. So yeah. He's no the devil or anything, he's just not really a real source for knowledge. If you read anything he writes, use it as a place to start digging deeper, double check any claim he makes, etc.  Also, he IS a great writer. Dude can weave a really awesome narrative.

"The Celtics never offered Kyrie an extension. They offered it to him the previous summer.  It was clear they didn't want Kyrie anymore and both his play style and toxic personality were holding back the young players on the team.  You aren't providing any facts here, you're providing socially inept interpretations of interviews, and conjecture. You clearly have trouble grasping what 'fact' even means.   Literally none of those ""facts"" you just mentioned are facts.  Just like the world being flat isn't a ""fact""  If you want to believe I'm calling you an idiot for anything other than your bad opinions (again not facts), sure go ahead.

Yes I did. The majority of assist leaders are ball hogs who eat up clock. One of the reasons people thought the Harden and CP3 Rockets weren't gonna work out was because it was two ball dominant guards on the same team. CP3 like LeBron has the ball in his hands most of the time before finally make the pass that leads to the assist. Magic used to be the same way.	1

No.  This is the problem with the media and trying to create mass hysteria by attaching the word 'deadly' to every headline because it's 'technically' correct.  The figures aren't completely settled but the from a few articles, just based off the amount of confirmed cases v. those who have died from it, the mortality rate is estimated to be between 2-4%. Obviously, there are cases that won't be noticed and deaths that will be 'missed' in the count. Those who are dying include the elderly and the immunocompromised.  But even then, to put in perspective, look at the annual influenza virus. I'd say most people consider it kind of a shitty nuisance to get around the holiday times, but the perception of the annual flu isn't marked by media outrage and fear mongering. The mortality rate for those aged 50-64 is about 9%.	1
It coincided with Tom Hanks getting it and Trump blubbering his way through a speech, all three things hammered home how fucked the situation really is.	1
Honestly, not my opinion, but a lot of this world doesn't give a shit about basketball or Kobe. And many don't idolize him the way people on this sub obviously do.   Hell spend a couple minutes on /r/losangeles during his death and many people only bring up the rape case.	0

Jordan's legacy would somehow be less if he made it to the Finals in 95 and lost to Hakeem rather than bowing out in the Semi's to the Magic like he did. It is absolutely retarded that losing in the Finals is more of a hit on you're legacy than losing in the earlier rounds! Has no one ever questioned how actually stupid this thinking is? If I could chose Everton getting to 3 F.A Cup Finals in a row and winning them all or getting to 7 in a row and winning 4 of them, I know which one I am picking without fucking hesitation mate! Yerrr... We may have lost 3 of them Finals but overall we won 4 and got to 7 straight Cup Finals rather than not even making it to the Final. Don't let this retarded media agenda fool you.	0

AI averaged 36 PPG in the finals against a Lakers team that swept everyone in the West. Iverson was supposed to get swept too but he made a statement in game 1 by carrying the 76ers top a win with 50 points. Curry only averaged 30 PPG last finals because pf his 47 point outlier, and he only got 47 points because Raptors were up 20 points the whole game so the defense was more relaxed. Every other finals he averaged 21-26 PPG on like 40% FG, there's a reason why he never won Finals MVP. Curry never scored when it mattered, he basically got trash points. Even the last finals when he averaged 30 PPG, Klay was the MVP as he was scoring with efficiency and scored to keep the game close. Curry was shooting them out of the games and then scored when GS was already up, thanks to Klay. Curry had that great 47 point game, but like I said, as great as that performance was, they were never a threat to get the game close so they were basically empty stats. Curry also has other players to take the pressure off of scoring from him and he still is inefficient and can't score when he's called to do it. You're trying to say Iverson never played the level of performance that Steph did in the finals? You're correct, because he was at a different level than Steph. Iverson was the only option and still scored on the Lakers, and that's with Shaq protecting the paint. You're so retarded it's hilarious. Bullshit nostalgia? Nah use your eyes and watch the game. Call a spade a spade when you see it, and the spade is that Curry can't score at will, Iverson can. That's why AI averaged 36 PPG in the finals, more than what Curry has averaged in FIVE finals appearances. That's why AI averaged 28-34 PPG in the regular season even though he was the only option to score and make plays during his prime. In terms of scoring, AI is better than Curry.	0

Kareem is lucky he peaked in the crack-infested '70s or he would have faced the same fate running into the Celtic dynasty year after year. He also became quite frail in his mid '30s, never averaging 10 rebounds a game or more from age 34 on. Surely a point of saltiness when compared to Wilt's greatness.  Ultimately, Wilt is *the* reason why Kareem is not looked at as the greatest, at immortality. How can you be if you're not even the greatest of your position?	1

Most of us are dead or dying, but I guess most would say life is good.  Humans figured out how to not kill each other or the earth—so on paper we’re lookin’ great.  Funny little brains we have though—sure, the bombs don’t drop anymore, but it seems humans need a common conflict to exist.  We are a restless species.  And, sure enough, we settled on our new common conflict in practically no time at all—ironic, isn’t that?—That the only thing we can agree on is what to fight over? Like I said—funny little brains.  So, yeah, we still have bombs—of course we do—we’re humans.  The bomb isn’t forewarned with sirens and followed by twisted flesh anymore though. Now the bomb attacks from within—until half your family, half your friends, half your liver...fuck—might as well be half your rotten mind—the bomb gets everyone.  A common human conflict just how we like it.  My mother died the night the Bucks won the 2020 championship—tragic—on a day that should have been pure joy, my mother died of a broken heart.  That broke everything. It was the last day I ever talked to my father. It was all just to much for him—the highs and lows, the money, the slumps—just too much. I guess my experience draws some parallels to his too—strange as that may sound.  It’s not special though. We’re just like every other family, every political party, every book club, every homeowner—hundreds of millions of families quit on each other over the same thing that week. Pretty quick, people quit on themselves—left clinging to their ideals while they slept alone and hardened.  Anyway, I don’t think I have anything else to say about life. I still don’t know why you wanted to hear about me. Like I said—ain’t nothin’ unique ‘bout me. Not since then and not when I die—we all die that one way or that other way ever since then—you know how it goes.  My father died that one way—he left me one thing in his will: a cramped storage unit that was late on rent and filled with trash cans. I didn’t even have to look—a I knew what the label on every single damn one of them said: “Khris Middleton.”  I hope that mean old fuck is burning in hell, because I’m sure as hell dying that other way—the right way—knowing Khris Middleton was a legitimate second-option superstar and the Bucks would not have won the 2020 NBA championship without him.  Kha$h fuckin’ Money ‘till my last breath—which should be any minute now, so how ‘bout you let me get back to dying, because I’ve got nothing to prove—just like James.	1

Doubt you will look into this, you'll probably just keep your head in the sand. 2009, 4g roll out. Swine Flu outbreak. 3g rolled out in 2001 - SARS outbreak 2002. Radio towers massively rolled out. Radio towers massively rolled out in 1910 - Spanish Flu outbreak in 1912.   5G rolled out....first in Wuhan China. 2nd in Spain. Third in Italy. Then the US (major port cities..NY, LA, Seattle).   Do you see a pattern? It may be nothing, but it is absolutely a pattern worth looking at.  The WHO seems radio frequency radiation as carcinogenic.  5G is used in WEAPON SYSTEMS for crowd control. 5G Network Uses Same EMF Waves As Pentagon Crowd Control System. ... Among the many potential problems with exposure to 5G radio waves are issues with the skin, which is interesting when you consider that this technology is already being used in the military for crowd control purposes.

[Because the Trump administration failed us. ](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/06/coronavirus-testing-failure-123166)   Edit: Apologies. This link appears to be outdated info. Per the comment below from u/terp_on_reddit, I did some quick research and he appears to be correct.   The Trump administration still failed us, though.   [The administration has implied the WHO test isn’t accurate enough,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/health/coronavirus-tests-who.html) which is not correct.   [Here’s a more recent article from ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-south-korea-scaled-coronavirus-testing-while-the-us-fell-dangerously-behind) contrasting the difference between America’s and South Korea’s responses:   The contrast to the United States, which tested a few thousand people in the weeks when health experts say the outbreak was spreading across this country, could not be more stark. Instead of using the template approved by the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention set out to create its own test from scratch, only to see that effort plagued by delay and dysfunction that continues to this day.  America’s inability to know who is infected has broad implications. It means that infected people have wandered through offices, buses, restaurants, emergency rooms and malls, indiscriminately spreading the virus.  Edit 2: One more addition since this is getting views.   Never forget that it never had to be as bad as it’s going to get.    Washington Post editorial: [I ran the White House pandemic office. Trump closed it. ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/nsc-pandemic-office-trump-closed/2020/03/13/a70de09c-6491-11ea-acca-80c22bbee96f_story.html)   “When President Trump took office in 2017, the White House’s National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense survived the transition intact. Its mission was the same as when I was asked to lead the office, established after the Ebola epidemic of 2014: to do everything possible within the vast powers and resources of the U.S. government to prepare for the next disease outbreak and prevent it from becoming an epidemic or pandemic.   One year later, I was mystified when the White House dissolved the office, leaving the country less prepared for pandemics like covid-19.”	1

"Names themselves are never racist, sexist, etc. in isolation. The word ""faggot"" itself is not homophobic, and ""bitch"" is not misogynistic. It's how those words have transformed over time to demonize specific groups of people that make them bad. In other words, context matters.  The context here is that people are being attacked because people inexplicably falsely equivocate ""Chinese Virus"" to mean people of Chinese descent have it and carry into their neighborhoods.   I guarantee you if MERS were ravaging America right now we would also see a movement to refer to it by its scientific name EMC-2012 as well and instead of Asians, it would be Middle Easterns being vilified (again, or still). And I would be all for it instead of defending xenophobic rhetoric on reddit because it literally wouldn't hurt me to do so and maybe save a life or two in the process.  You have actual redditors in this very thread talking about how their lives are being affected by this type of rhetoric that emboldens racists. Posts like yours that deflect and miss the forest for the trees doesn't make things any better.  > not a reason to call somebody a racist  The past 3.5 years aside, the POTUS speaks on behalf of all Americans, does he not? If there is rhetoric that instigates violence against Americans, should he use it? Just because the word itself is just a synonym doesn't make it okay."	0

> That's still what happened. It's basketball. That can happen again  Except that's incredibly unlikely to happen again and if the series were replayed, that wouldn't happen in the vast majority of replays. The Raptors and Bucks were the better teams last season by almost every major metric (offense, defense, best player, etc.). The Sixers weren't even the second best team in their own conference.    > By very basic reasoning, the truth of how things played out suggests that we were the second best team in the playoffs  By this logic, the 49-33 Mavericks were the second best team of the 2014 playoffs because they pushed the eventual champions to 7 in the first round. We both know that's absurd.	1

Those picks could easily be more valuable than the thunders picks if they tried to contend for the next few years. Nobody has any idea what Houston or the clippers will look like in 3 years it would be supremely retarded to give 4-5 of those up for a very small chance at a championship. Just because nobody looks unbeatable doesn’t mean the thunder would become anywhere near championship favorites with Beal or Holiday. Not to mention you still have to match salaries meaning they’d have to give away a huge piece of the team no matter what.	0

"This is what I don't get about this whining about the Raptors ""easy schedule"".  It isn't rocket science. There are more bad teams this year so of course there are more teams under 500. Look at everyone else during their last 15 games. Sure as shit they're going to be facing mostly teams under .500  With all these teams ""better than the Raptors"" also playing roughly the same amount of teams under .500 during this stretch, why don't all of them have the same kind of streak, if not more?  Also, what does it say going to the other side of this argument, that these superior teams are losing a lot more games to teams under .500? Must be a shitty team to keep losing to teams without a winning record.  This obsession with discrediting the Raptors streak right now is beyond pathetic. I find it even more funny considering the amount of injuries we have had. But go on, keep spreading this shit if that helps you feel comfortable about your team."	1

My dude you are a clown. You posted blatantly wrong information that the tallest player is the “de facto center” as if there’s no difference between middle school basketball and pro hoops. Who plays center and what skills they possess varies for every team and what they want. Ya it’s usually the tallest player, but you were just calling dudes a center because they are the tallest. It’s also awesome how one of the sources you credit, outside of the wiki page that only has information any 6th grade who’s seen a basketball game would know, is basically “trust me I know what I’m talking about”, like you Just discovered a new element because you know that centers are tall.  I disregarded the rest of your “argument” because it’s nonsense, you can’t be older than 14, nobody needed you to write 3 paragraphs to try to prove that centers are tall lmao all anyone was saying is that center is a position usually played by the tallest player, but to say the tallest player is the “de facto center” is just outright wrong especially in the nba.   Lastly, I’m going to guess that you play center because you have some sort of strange fondness for the position itself. They’re the “baddest” lmao nobody harder then Sean Bradley or Robin Lopez	0

**Will McGee, athletic director at Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary, lifelong friend:** I’ve been playing basketball with ’Bron since we were 8, and he’s always been good. But some of the things he does now, he did back when he was a kid. If he took a hit or something, he would be down for a while. You don’t know if he’s hurt or if he’s not.  We were in eighth grade, playing in the Indiana Black Expo tournament. Good tournament, we make it to the championship. And we’re getting our doors blown off. We’re losing by 20-plus. So he goes down, hard foul, because when you’re good they’re always trying to foul you hard. We’re pushing, trying to get people away from him, make sure he’s cool, and one of our coaches called us over, one of our assistant coaches, while our head coach was out there tending to him. I remember him distinctly saying, “Now, mind you, we’re still in this game. We gotta stay focused. LeBron may be hurt, or he may not be hurt. We don’t know. We don’t know, but we gotta keep playing.”  And we’re like, “All right, he’s right, we gotta keep playing.” So we come back, tie the game. We end up going to overtime. LeBron missed the rest of the game, in regulation. But then in overtime he’s all right to play. Comes back, scores 20 points, maybe like 12 in a row. We end up winning by 10. And when I tell you we were laughing the rest of the way home after we won that tournament. He was like, “I couldn’t feel my arm or leg for a minute. But I knew I had to get back out there and help. I had to do something.”  We said, “Yeah, after we tied it up, I bet you did want to bring it on home.” That is etched in stone in my head.  We were in practice one day and he went down and did that, and coach was like, “Get up! I get scared every time you go down. My heart drops every time you start rolling on the ground. Get up if you ain’t injured.”  Man, that’s been him. He takes his time getting up.  **George Hill, Milwaukee Bucks, former Cavs teammate:** When I think of LeBron, I don’t think of what he does on the court; I think of what he does off the court that makes him special. For me, the things he does as far as endorsement-wise, him having a Beats deal, making sure all of us have Beats, and numerous pairs of them. I think I have so many Beats, shitloads of them in my closet because we got so many. Him having that Thom Browne suit deal, getting all of us three suits and shoes and glasses and headphones to match the suits.  Stuff like that, that you don’t really read about or see about, I think that’s what kind of makes him special. It’s the thought, because he didn’t have to do none of that. He’s his own man and he doesn’t have to include us in anything, but he knows that we’re all a team and we’re all together and he looks out for his teammates a lot.  **Steve Kerr, Golden State Warriors coach, four-time Finals adversary:** I remember his rookie year, when he went to Cleveland, his rookie year was my first year broadcasting. My first year out of the league, and I went to do a game. And I met his mom, and his mom said, “Steve Kerr, you’re a bad man. I was like, “OK, that’s cool. LeBron’s mom just called me a bad man.” That’s a great feeling.  **Kevin Love, Cleveland Cavaliers, former Cavs teammate:** D-Wade has said it before and I hate that I have to quote him. But when we go international, which is obviously always Toronto, he won’t turn on his phone. It’s only WiFi. He’s the cheapest fucking guy. He’s like, “That’s bullshit. I won’t turn on my phone.” He won’t turn on data roaming. He’ll only go when we’re either at the arena or at the Shangri-La, “Hey, what’s the WiFi?” Internationally and in Toronto, he’ll never pay for it.  ***From Team Banana Boat …***  **Chris Paul, All-Star, Oklahoma City Thunder, former Team USA teammate**: The night before Game 4 (of the 2007 Finals), that’s when his son was born. Bryce. Yeah, I was there. I was coming to the Finals games, so I was staying with him. It was my first or second year in the league, and we were at the house. And, Vannah (LeBron’s wife, Savannah) had gone to the doctor, and I think called back to the house and said, “I think my water broke,” or something like that. And me and him got in the car to go to the Cleveland Clinic. We were there all night. Me and LeBron, Randy (Mims), Mav (Maverick Carter), Rich (Paul) his mom, all of us.  We were there all night, and then just waiting for Bryce to be born. He had Game 4 of the Finals the next day. Man, we were playing cards, we were doing all types of stuff. We were waiting, waiting for Vannah to deliver the baby. I remember she had him late, and we went back to the house. It was late, late. Crazy. Obviously, they got swept the next day.  **Dwyane Wade, TV analyst, 13-time All-Star, former Heat, Cavs, Team USA teammate:** With LeBron, I got a chance to see him at his lowest, after the 2011 Finals. When it came to losing in the Finals with the Heat, and not living up to his own and everyone else’s expectations. I watched him take it all on the chin and pick himself up off the ground and embraced it all. He bet on his work ethic and pure love for the game.  **Carmelo Anthony, Portland Trail Blazers, 10-time All-Star, former Team USA teammate:** Him being better with his left hand than his right hand. He does everything. He throws with his left, he writes with his left. He does everything with his left. When you see stuff like that, when you see people that can do things the same with both hands, whether it’s sports or regardless of what it is, that’s a special person. I don’t know too many people who can do that. I know one other person, probably Russ (Westbrook). Russ writes with his left and does things with his left, then gets on the court and won’t go left (laughs). These guys are one-of-a-kind when it comes to that.	1

Jordan's legacy would somehow be less if he made it to the Finals in 95 and lost to Hakeem rather than bowing out in the Semi's to the Magic like he did.

No. Lebron uses franchises to get what he wants. He's never made one successful. Let's be real. He didn't join the cavs because of Cleveland.  He joined because they had kyrie. A ton of trade assets and no one on the books so he could sign his good friends.

"The very connotation of ""No homo"" is that being homo is something bad or to be ashamed of that you need to specifically say you're not that.   Imagine if someone said ""I like watermelon"" and then followed it up with ""No black person"". That'd be totally fucked up right? There's nothing wrong with liking watermelon and it's narrow minded to make a statement that specifically links it to a black person. In that same vein there's nothing wrong with admiring or praising another person of the same gender and it's narrow minded to make a statement that doing so is explicitly homosexual in nature.   No one's stopping you from saying ""jokes"" but don't be surprised when people assume you're an asshole for telling them.  Edit: If trying to be a little empathetic and more accepting is too much for your pride you do not need to respond to this trying to justify your immature behavior to me. I'm not trying to force beliefs on anyone, rather just educate and maybe help someone see why saying ""No homo"" is considered offensive. The world is already a mean enough place.  Edit 2: Thank you reddit for repeatedly stating that homosexuality and being black are not the same thing. No kidding! I never said they were, but both the homosexual community and the black community have faced discrimination for who they are which is why I tried to use the example I did to illustrate how both types of ""joking"" are wrong. Also, there are no thought police and no one is going to prevent you from being a hateful vulgar piece of shit. I apologize for having the audacity for wanting to help spread a little empathy and explain why something like ""no homo"" could come off as being hurtful and offensive to people."	1

John Wall WILL be fine and WILL still be an all-star caliber player when he returns especially with all the medical advances today. A lot of people seem to forget that these are ELITE ATHLETES/ ALPHA MALES physically. They are not your normal human beings. The achilles he tore was on was not on the leg he jumps from plus looking at his workouts he still looks pretty damn fast.   John Wall himself says that this is the most healthiest that he's been since his rookie year or something like that. Which is reasonably because he's been carrying the team for a long time but now that Beal is a top SG in the nba he doesn't have to carry a lot.  If this was the 90s or 2000s when the league was at it's most physical, then yea I would be a little concerned but in TODAY'S nba where teams allow dudes to walk in the lane and defense is sooooo weak, I'm not worried about Wall one bit. I predict that he'll average around 18 pts, 10 asts, 6 rebs, 1.5 stls, 0.9 blks next season.  To your Derrick Rose point. Rose has said himself that he holds back and doesn't play as hard as he used to due to his prior injuries because he is thinking about life after basketball and being able to do things with his son etc. The man still has hops.	0

">People think that it's supposed to be this miracle of science, a perfect shield against one of the most mutable viruses in existence. It's not.  No one thinks it's a perfect shield. But it's essentially a ""if you can help yourself and possibly prevent yourself from coming down with the flu,"" then why not get the vaccine. There's very rarely a serious reaction to the vaccine unless you have an egg allergy, but I don't even think this an issue anymore in the inactivated flu vaccine over the live attenuated.  People shouldn't look at the flu vaccine as a 'damned if you do, damned if you don't"" option. The researchers who develop the vaccine rely heavily on epidemiological data and attempt to 'beat the flu' to the punch, so that by time the virus has spread to the US, in this case, people have received the vaccine and developed a strong immunity to it.  But as you've pointed out, the flu can mutate/undergo antigenic shift so that the annual strain is different year in, year out. It's not a perfect solution.  But stating:  >Healthy adults in their prime don't need it.  is really not helpful and severely understates the vaccine's effectiveness."	1

> He grew up playing soccer and ice hockey but lived in poverty in the Saint-Michel neighborhood. He dropped out of high school at age 16 and worked as a cook and dishwasher in a St-Hubert restaurant.[3] In 2012, he was offered a spot on a tournament basketball team, and scored 44 points in the tournament final.  It seems that like Giannis, he is a soccer reject who started to play Basketball late in life because he realised that being tall is the most important thing in Basketball and he is very tall.  In 2012 he was 19 years old... He played his first Basketball game at the age of 19.   So yes, he is in the NBA just because he is very tall.  What a dumb sport.  Then you wonder why Gobert did what he did.... he is an entitled prick who is getting paid millions just for being very tall, like this Boucher dude.	0
You're funny. A troll post? How?   Everything i said is true  He didn't get half the defensive attention any star in NBA history on those teams, Supper inefficent and bad playmaking playoff games were not rare for KD before he joined the warriors and the team he joined without him won  - 67 games  - NBA championship  - 73 games  - 3rd longest win streak ever  - Made B2B finals  - 3 years later they finished off houston, swept portland, made another finals and took the raps to 6 despite 2 klay injuries    Trolling?

It's not the same as the grandma scenario, stop using it. Kobe is commanding someone to surrender their seat, totally different from your grandma asking you politely if she can have your seat. Also Kobe is an athlete who can afford to stand the whole game if he needs to, or just wait for someone to bring another seat, not a grandma who probably cant stand for more than a few minutes without a lot of discomfort.	1

[Mod Post] New Mod Application Thread  It's that time of the year again and we're looking for new mods!  In particular, we are looking for mods to assist our team with further automating subreddit processes. We are also looking for mods to help remove/approve posts and answer modmail.   Please answer these questions in your comment.  * What timezone do you currently live in? Central   * What are your normal reddit operating hours? I am available most of the time as a student I look through reddit throughout the day.   * Roughly how much time do you spend on /r/nba on a daily basis? Probably my top 3 subs I use so a lot of the time I’m scrolling through r/nba   * How long have you been a part of our community and why do you think you'd be a good addition to the mod team? I’ve been on r/nba a few years now and enjoy it a lot. I think it’s one of the most progressive subs especially for sports.   * If there's one thing you could change about /r/nba, what would that be? Probably more clear rules on why things are getting taken down.   * What is your favorite NBA memory? When Steven Adams missed a free throw on purpose to give it to Russ for the 3.  * Do you have any experience with CSS? Not really but I pick up on things fast.   * Do you have any experience with PRAW or python? Feel free to link anything you have created using them. I use python for classes. I’m in engineering so it’s mostly for math needs.  * Do you have any experience hosting python script? No but I can learn  * Are you interested in helping mod the sub discord? Yes   Basketball is my favorite sport and without it I’d have a lot less entertainment in my life   The rest is up to you guys. Feel free to add anything else that you think might help make a case for why you should be a moderator for /r/nba.  All unrelated comments will be removed for sake of readability. Keep in mind that the amount of upvotes you get in this thread will not have an impact on your application. Please direct all questions to the sticky comment.	1

I remember nearly throwing my phone when Dwight got waived multiple times. He wasn't prime Dwight, but he literally just put up a 32/30 game.

>> Sorry but no? More exposure does not mean more cases, just more deaths because hospitals cant handle all those cases.  That's all people care about.

If we have to stop playing rec ball for a couple months then so be it. I think any reasonable person can agree that people not dying > people playing recreational basketball.	0

I am saying of the **top rebounders in the NBA** and you're comparing Giannis' rebounding statistics to Lebron, Harden, and Westbrook?  &#x200B;  Top 5 Rebounders:  &#x200B;  Drummond @ 15. 8 REB  Gobert @ 14.6 REB  Whiteside @ 14 REB  Capela @ 13.8 REB  Giannis @ 13.4 REB  [https://stats.nba.com/players/rebounding/?sort=REB&dir=1](https://stats.nba.com/players/rebounding/?sort=REB&dir=1)  &#x200B;  Top 5 Contested Rebounders:  &#x200B;  Drummond @ 7.3 C.

Of the top 5 rebounders, Giannis is by far the lowest in both the contested and offensive rebounding categories. Giannis is #5 in total rebounds, #16 at contested rebounds, and #29 at offensive rebounds. Compare that to Drummond who is #1 in all 3 categories, Capela who is #4 total rebounds, #3 contested, and #2 offensive, etc.	1

Trump is going to bend Biden over a barrel in November (you know, like Biden does to non-consenting women) and you’re tragically going to have to suffer through 4 more years of absolute success in America.

I was never talking about unbeatable. Michael Jordan needed Scottie to get out of the 2nd round. That is what I said. I never said Scottie was his best when they first made it out of the 2nd round. I also said nurk would give Lillard a chance to make it out of the 2nd round, implying they could compete potentially in the wcf with him. That was all I said. Then you brought up cj in comparison to Scottie when they don’t provide the same sort of core value to the offense and defense that nurk/Scottie do/did in comparison. I think you are slightly undervaluing young Scottie because they ended up losing, when I am only talking about competing, not completely dominating.	1

Scottie’s defense and gravity allowed them to beat the Knicks. Without him they might have lost.

MJ never won a single series as an underdog. he just wasn't a guy who made a bad team good, he made good teams great  look at the retirement period in the mid 90s, they won 55 without him then he came back with a month to go the next season and while they were upset, they went into the playoffs as the title favorites.

"So it's more complicated than that, but I don't think the Nets should be blamed.  Basically the United States CDC decided to develop their own test. They did this because they didn't want to rely on the WHO test. Their initial problems generally stemmed from the fact China was refusing to ship virus specimen samples, so we had to get them from someplace else in the early days.  Then they fucked up the first test they created which basically meant they had to design a second one. They also had to throw out about 150,000 testing kits which had them on pace with what the WHO had developed at the time.  The problem is further compounded by the fact that the laboratory testing equipment the CDC and public laboratories have is sometimes different than that in most major research hospitals, which is generally different than that in most regional hospitals, and what is available in private labs is often a mixture. That is why you have different insurance networks in contact with different labs developing their own testing capabilities, so they can insure that their network has access to testing.   These things take time - it's not really a lack of resources. There is all the money they need and basically every lab that does this sort of thing, both public and private, are working on it.  So it's not just a matter of ""put money into increasing production,"" or ""buying them from abroad."" It's not like there is a plethora of equipment used for RNA extraction of samples just lying around, or a massive untapped manufacturing capability for that sort of specialized equipment.  But the reason I disagree with people casting this as ""rich versus poor"" is that diagnostic criteria for testing people is often going to involve behavior and the number of people that a subject would come into close contact with. Someone like an NBA player is at greater risk than your average Joe because they get swarmed by fans in public, not to mention they are effectively part of a population where n = 450 and public health officials know some of them are infected, so testing that whole population makes sense from a medical perspective."	0

Every superstar gets hate, for some reason.   But on top of that, Curry rose to superstardom during LeBron’s prime. Instead of having 5 or 6 rings and being the undisputed GOAT, LeBron has an abysmal 3-6 finals record which is really the main argument for him being ranked below Jordan.   Curry’s rise prevented LeBron from being recognized as the greatest ever across the NBA community. I think there’s a lot of resentment stemming from Bronsexuals for that.	0

Why do people continue to insist Jokic is out of shape? Granted the guy is a big guy and he starts out slow then absolutely takes over the game.

"Oh my god, this is getting embarassing for you.  > He literally used Stockton and Curry as the examples and gave examples of how different models would effect the outcomes, and it works perfect opposite of how you think it does. The literal calculation has Stockton far and away better and its only after applying the statistical model that gives greater weight to higher achieving individual seasons that Curry jumps up the rankings.  You do realize that this is with a new model that weights longevity even more heavily at it's base right (even before the corrections to the curve)...   You do realize that the guy who made these models himself does not use that one for his top 40 list, precisely because it's even less accurate than the original model right...  Why do you think Curry is ranked higher than Stockton in his top 40, that was updated in 2019, despite him exploring this new (innacurate) model in 2018? C'mon kid, use your head for once.  > In other words, exactly what I said at the start of the conversation and exactly opposite of what you claimed it did.  Except it's not. You're confusing the experimental model's data with the original model's (which is what I made used to back up my claims), you fucking buffoon.  How do you get so confused so often? That's been a consistent theme for you in this thread. Looooooooooooooooool.  > still have yet to read the article.  You do see the irony in this right?  > We both know you didn't actually read that shit  Funny, since you clearly didn't read my comments.  What's defensible about:   > West still had the ball in his hands more than Goodrich, especially during the prime of West's career when he played like 40 minutes a game. Goodrich didn't handle the ball as much as West until the 70 season when he returned to the Lakers  You still don't understand that having the ball in your hands doesn't make you a point guard.   Maybe that's why you turned tail and ran away from this:  *More ignorance. Being a score first guard doesn't preclude you from being a point guard, and handling the ball more/averaging more assists than a PG doesn't imply that you're a PG.*  *LeBron handles the ball (and averages more assists) than many point guards. Larry Bird did too. They were both better pure passers than the majoirty of PGs, and yet they are considered small forwards. Harden and Jokic handle the ball a ton and also average more assists than most PGs. Should we consider them PGs instead of SG and C then? Of course not.*  *For more than half of West's career, he played alongside Gail Goodrich. They were both combo guards and could play both positions, so that's where the confusion comes from. Some people say West was the PG and Goodrich was the SG, but most (in my experience) have West as the SG. There's a reason you see Jerry West on all-time SG rankings more often than you do on PG rankings.*  *For example, ESPN has him on their all-time [SG rankings](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/nbarankSGs/ranking-top-10-shooting-guards-ever), and not on their all-time [PG rankings](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/nbarankPGs/ranking-top-10-point-guards-ever)*  You thought being a score first player has anything to do with whether you are a point guard or not. Wrong.  You thought if a player averages more assists than a point guard then he must also be a point guard. Wrong.  You keep zero-ing on whether West was an SG or PG, which is irrelevant to this discussion as Curry had both a better peak and better resume. And I've already said that it's subjective but that way more people have him as an SG for a reason.  On this sub, and on /r/ nbadiscussion ([example here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cj5gtp/who_are_your_top_5_shooting_guards_of_alltime/)), way more people consider him to be an SG than a PG. ESPN didn't have him on the PG list, neither did Bleacher Report. But again, it's irrelevant in regards to whether Stockton is better than Curry, or in regards to whether Curry had a higher peak and better resume.  > You also said Curry was better than West regardless of position, which is actually insane.  No, it's really not. I said he had a better peak and resume, and since I value those highly I would have him over West. And clearly many people agree.   *Turns out Bleacher Report's [rankings from 2019](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2852716-nba-all-time-player-rankings-top-10-point-guards#slide9) also don't consider West a PG. They also have Curry above Stockton, and at #2 overall.*  *In fact, the majority of rankings I've found online that were made recently (after Curry's MVPs and championships and numerous elite seasons) have Curry above Stockton. Quite a few have him in the #2 spot as well.*  *This writer for [nba.com](https://www.nba.com/magic/news/ranking-point-guards-history-3-20180126) does have West as a PG, which is a point for you, but they also have Curry in the #2 spot (easily above Stockton).*  *I checked out what the folks over at /r/ nbadiscussion think, and the [majority over there](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ax2s4w/steph_currys_all_time_point_guard_ranking/) seem to have Curry as the #2 PG of all-time as well.*  And let's not forget how you just straight up lied to inflate Stockton's impact:  *This is wrong. First of all, Magic literally had a better assist per game rate over his career. And even if you were talking about best assist per game rate over a single season, then that's still a ""dishonest stat"" as there are multiple players who would have had better assist per game rates than Stockton if they were on those Jazz teams. Stockton is practically the only PG to play his entire starting career alongside one of the best ten scorers in NBA history.*  *And if your comment was referring to best per game rates in a single season, then when it comes to defensive stats you would be even more wrong. There have been multiple players who have exceeded Stockton's career high in defensive stats in a single season (and multiple players who have better per game defensive stats for their career).*  *So whether you meant that no player has matched Stockton's per game assist and defensive stat rates in his peak seasons or over his career, that's a straight up lie. For both steals and assists there are players who have exceeded Stockton's career per game rates, and quite a few players who have exceeded his season-high defensive stat rates.

>In 2018-19, this possession would have been credited to Harkless since he defended Russell for five seconds in the frontcourt compared to two seconds for Harrell. However, it is Harrell that contests Russell’s shot attempt, while Harkless is inside the key defending Paschall at the time of the shot.  >Heading into the 2019-20 season, the matchup data has received an overhaul to resolve situations like this and provide the most accurate information available. **Now matchup data is being captured at every moment in the game, so if a switch occurs, two players will be assigned matchup time against that offensive player and the data will show who is actually defending the shots.**  does this resolve the issue you are referring to?	0

Rookie Scottie in the playoffs averaged 26 minutes in there 3-2 win in the first round. I never said Scottie was better as a rookie, than cj is now. More so I’m talking about team fit not individual talent. The bulls needed someone who could raise their overall defense to elite, given mjs dominance in volume on offense and defense. Pippen provided that bump at the time. CJ alone doesn’t raise the teams at both ends in the same way. With MJ, they didn’t need a lot pieces to compete, but they still needed pieces.	1

He can give a diplomatic response without giving him a glowing recommendation and absolving him of all blame.  > I never said dlo was better, I said they were comparable. As in they're both inferior guards who will never contend for championships as the main piece. At the end of the day I'm sure the Celtics would have rather had dlo than Kyrie Irving, the Celtics would rather have an inferior kemba walker than Kyrie too.  And again, they aren’t comparable in any way. I promise you the Celtics would rather have Kyrie than DLo and Kemba. In fact they tried re-signing Kyrie even *after* all the drama. They only settled on Kemba after Kyrie chose the Nets.  > Where are your ""facts""? You provided anecdotes and opinions and absolutely no facts.

"It's not devaluing if you value different things. It's why everyone has a different person for the GOAT Convo.  If I was able to change history, I'd say James Harden didn't deserve his and Giannis's MVP coming up would also go to LeBron.  Others disagree because it's TRUE, Harden had 15 more wins, but his stats were worse and he clearly had better help, along with a very strong narrative of being ""ROBBED"" twice. Everyone was on his dick in 2018.  And Giannis ALSO deserves MVP, his season is comparable to 2013 LeBron and 2016 Curry, but I'd still choose LeBron because I feel like he's still better and has a bigger impact.  My opinions are just that, opinions. Learn to make your own judgements."	0

Giannis has been the front runner, but it's still a two person race, and it wouldn't be if everyone agreed there was only one clear choice. I can't explain it to you any more clearly than that.

1. The Warrior were better the season before Durant than they were with Durant.  2. Curry is more unguardable than Durant (if it were the other way around, Durant would be the one with 2 MVPs) 3. Steph was dropping 30 a game in 34 minutes; KD needed 38+ 4. Steph let KD have more shots because he is a team player with no ego and knew KD's fragile ego needed to feel like he was the man.   I mean, when KD won the Finals MVP, all he could do was go off about how hard it is to set yourself apart from other players on a great team rather than give his teammates credit for opening things up for him.

They won more games against the pistons in 89 than in 88. They took the pistons to 6 games in 89. Pippen had 9 steals and 8 blocks in that 6 game series. He shot 67% ts against the knicks as well. Although he did struggle offensively against the world championship pistons. No one took them past 6 that year at all. they swept the lakers in comparison.  Cj doesn’t provide the defensive versatility of Pippen, who even in his second year he was averaging 2 steals and a block a game. CJ knows that he has to show up on offense to be a positive on the outcome of the game. Pippen provided a lot to the bulls even in his rookie year. His size and court coverage were impressive. He averaged 1.2 steals and .7 blocks on just 20 minutes.    My argument is that MJ needed Pippen to get to the finals/wcf. So saying that Lillard is not clutch when he hasn’t been to the finals is somewhat ridiculous in my opinion. Even in his rookie season MJ was making game winners in clutch time. If his team was never good enough to get to the finals in hindsight, MJ would still be clutch as a person. Judging clutchness by finals appearance, is IMO the sign of being ignorant that titles are a team achievement, not a player achievement by and large. Like I would say Gilbert arenas was clutch, but he barely made the playoffs.	1

Or Mr. Rapist who's ""struggling"" because they're on 10 years probation for raping a 14 year old girl, despite serving no jail time?  > Everything is relative my guy  Exactly.  To me, the ""struggles"" I listed as well as the ""struggles"" of those who earn 600K+ but live paycheck to paycheck are ridiculous and trivial, just like any struggles I have had in my life pale in comparison to those of a homeless guy or a chronically ill person.  Everyone has their own perspective on how big a struggle is based on their own experiences.  I think it's absolutely justified for someone to dismiss the struggles of others or lack sympathy when they've faced far greater challenges."	0

"> You just can't read between the lines if you think Brown's response is anything but a standard diplomatic response about a former teammate.  Brown has no reason to come to his defence. If he really had a problem with him he could have just as easily said absolutely nothing at all.  It isn’t just Brown either. Smart has said the same. You’re telling me all of these players are lying, and you’re the one who’s telling the truth?Come on now.  > Why do you refuse to acknowledge that Brown and Tatum took a step forward this year because Kyrie is gone? It's fairly clear that you refuse to acknowledge any narrative that involves Kyrie taking any blame for the Celtics last season.  That isn’t “clear” whatsoever.  Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are 3rd overall picks in their 3rd and 4th seasons respectively. This is exactly when they’re *supposed* to be taking a leap into star players. Their play this season is literally a natural, year to year progression that elite young prospects are supposed to go through. It isn’t anywhere near as simple as “Kyrie’s gone so they’re better”. Their play this season is the result of several seasons work in the league and the game finally slowing down for them.  > Me calling you an idiot is not ""taking this personally"" the same way I can call flat earthers idiots casually and not be emotionally invested.  Throwing personal insults because somebody disagrees with you about a basketball player is absolutely taking it personally. Especially when that person comes with facts. You’re just upset you lost an argument.  > You are the one who seems personally invested in this Kyrie adoration, not me  In what way? I have no reason to adore Kyrie. I’m just not small minded enough to let r/nba narratives affect my opinion of a player.  Let me put it simply. There isn’t a single front office in the league that would trade Kyrie for DLo should they have the chance. Not a single one. If you believe any of them would then your player evaluation skills are severely lacking."	0

Sorry but you should inform yourself on the situation. I'm a Nursing student, all you said was just plain wrong. More exposure means more cases, this virus spreads quite easily and it takes 2 weeks to for it to act, so there will be infected people that without knowing will be infecting others. Plus, the more cases in the Hospital, the worse it gets in there and it doesn't mean outside the Hospital the situation is better, because it likely isn't. The bigger the strain on the Hospitals, the likelier it is that health care providers will become infected and will have to be treated or quarantined themselves, putting an even bigger strain on the Hospital.  Just stay home when you can. You don't know who's infected and if you're already infected, so don't go out infecting others.	0

"Sorry but no? More exposure does not mean more cases, just more deaths because hospitals cant handle all those cases.

I would assume in a perfect world we could completely quarantine everybody for like a month and itd be over superfast but this is not a perfect world."	0

"I hate doing this, and I'm sorry if it's slightly off-subject in the sense it isn't related to the NBA, but I just want to get this message out in case it protects anyone else (or their mothers) from comas and ventilators: Please do not shop at Mattress Firms across the country (USA) until this is over. It is not a sanitary - and therefore safe - environment to put yourself in during the current ongoing pandemic.   Local leadership in my area made this and asked us to post it to social media:  https://imgur.com/EWSJKr  No matter how sarcastic or tongue-in-cheek that image must seem, I assure you, it's not. :(  They held a video conference yesterday (3/24) advising all employees that even in the event the government specifically declares them as NOT exempt from a shelter in place order, they will challenge it.  Because the corporate honchos in Houston know more than the governments, scientists, and doctors around the world urging people to stay home and flatten the curve.  As part of the official company response, we have been instructed to post ""cleaning logs"" around the store that we sign to ""prove"" we clean the stores twice a day.   Cleaning supplies are low and none are available in local grocery stores. Corporate gave everyone a $50 credit for Office Depot online, which has also been OOS on everything. When asked on the conference call what to do when the supplies available do run out, we were told to ask our DMs to buy some locally.  Think about how many beds and pillows the average customer touches and lays on while picking out a new bed. And then please consider the staggering amount of Lysol/ Clorox cans a store would need to have stocked up in the back to constantly sanitize each and every surface that is touched. Granted, we do offer pillow protectors - that are kept stacked in an open-to-the-air box and touched by every single guest who goes to grab one. Now finally ask yourself if you still feel like that is a truly sanitary environment to shop in right now?  Don't worry though, there's some great news! If you get sick while working this essential position, you get unpaid furlough and no disaster/emergency pay. Also they froze accrued PTO so no sick pay either. But they can't get supplies out to these essential businesses and employees to keep them sanitized and safe to work in.   It's not only unethical, I believe it is (or at least should be) illegal. They are actively fighting against flattening the curve just so they don't lose even more sales than they already have."	0

bro these people are retarded europeans are racist as fuck esp soccer fans. i mean bulgarian fans already have two incidents of mocking black players from the uk within the last two years. im not saying the us isn’t racist but people seriously downplay how racist other countries are (and other races) try being black in china or japan or any asian dominant area, you’re gonna get stares and some people will be afraid of u  off topic but mexicans are also racist as fuck towards black ppl. i worked as a dispatcher for a plumbing company when i was younger and a lot of the guys who did things like excavation were illegals and those dudes were racist as fuck. always calling the black dudes they worked with dumb monkeys or some shit in spanish lol it was pretty wild	0

> The Grizzlies made it known what their asking price for Evans was (a first round pick), and various teams around the league decided not to give the Grizzlies what they wanted. Wallace decided it was in the team’s best interest to keep Tyreke in hopes of re-signing him this summer. Wallace was definitely stubborn in his approach, **demanding a first round pick and not accepting some of the rumored alternative deals.**  That’s the key part there. Teams were still willing to give up *something* for Evans, just not a first rounder. Either way, it’s a very different situation than a player potentially getting bought out.  By the way, I understand you’re a Lakers fan and expect things to get handed to you just because, but you’re not getting Iggy for free, end of story.	1

You are watching way too much main stream news. No one is dying outside of normal flu numbers. ZERO babies are dying. Which means it’s a particularly weak flu.   The only people who are dying are old, or sick people. Exactly like the regular flu.   If there is ANY uptick in deaths, it’ll be because we had a second flu season.   Stop spreading panic. Or... show me a single people who was healthy that died from it.	0

"I edited my comment to give you an example of what I'm trying to explain. I don't know if you read it before replying to I'm going to copy paste it here.  > Edit: Here's an example that I hope my resonate with you. The [swastika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika) is the go to symbol of white hate groups, but when used by Hindus and Buddhists it represents love and peace. Context changes the meaning of a symbol because almost all simple symbols have versatile uses.   > That said a symbol representing one concept does not invalidate it's representation of another concept. If a swastika is used in a town with no Hinduism or Buddhism to be found then it's pretty easy to tell they're bigots in the community.  > What you're saying is that because the ""OK"" symbol is used by people to say ""you're good to go"" it can't also mean ""white power"" when used in a certain context. Which just doesn't make sense with any bit of logic involved.  Keep in mind you moving the conversation to Hitler is avoiding the issue at hand with whataboutism and further goalpost moving but I'll try to use your example.  Hitler taking pictures with his dog is one guy. Sure he's a horribly bigot monster but he's still one person. One person doing something doesn't make it a trend.  Now lets say people in hate groups made an active effort to buy one kind of dog; lets say bulldog. They then constantly make efforts to take group pictures with their bulldogs, posting those pictures in connection to bigoted comments, mentioning their bulldogs during their sentencing for hate crimes, their clothing has patches of bulldogs on them, etc.  Well when that happens you have a clear indication that with regards to white nationalists the bulldog is a hate symbol.  This scenario doesn't mean that taking pictures with dogs is racist, or that having a bulldog is racist, it just means that if someone who you already expected possibly being a bigot is making an effort to bring up/show bulldogs then you have further reason to suspect them.   So lets say you have that politician who constantly supports programs that negatively impact minorities and he's always rocking a bulldog tie or pin. Well, then you would want to look into his history and see if it's just a coincidence or maybe he has a history of bigotry, possibly even a connection to a hate group that's gone under the radar  But in our world a large number of bigots have never appropriated dogs or pictures with them into being a symbol of white supremacy so this isn't true. Instead we have the fact they've clearly adopted the ""OK"" symbol to be used as a signal of white supremacy.   As such when being used by a bigot it's a hate symbol even if it wouldn't be when used by someone else. That's how context works."	1

The test shit is so overblown. Most people don't need a test. The treatment is the same as a common flu. Rest + fluids, tylenol/NSAIDs for fever and aches, go to hospital if you have breathing issues or high/prolonged fever. Isolate yourself from others.  Getting a test does nothing for you beyond giving you something to post on twitter about. If you're sick stay home even if its not COVID-19. Testing at this point is only really useful on non-symptomatic people who won't know to quarantine otherwise. But, we can't test hundreds of millions of people every week so that's not ever going to be an option. Everyone should chill on the testing nonsense and just assume they have it if they get sick.	0

"It's all the same thing. What he said isn't even the PC version. In black culture a man being ""feminine,"" ""a bitch,"" ""having female tendencies,"" or just outright being called gay are all the same. The thought is that a man is supposed to be strong or whatever and the woman weak and submissive  Many black people do not differentiate between femininity and homosexuality for a guy. I've had many conversations like that. When I told my fam that they are men that go through the process of being defined as a woman that still date women they just couldn't compute. Like if you told a robot a paradox.  Quotes like the one from Morris exemplifies this. He knew what he was saying and what he was saying is all the same."	1

Yes, overall support has increased.  But still support lags significantly by certain minority segments of the US population   https://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/  That's the pew poll from this past summer.  Hispanics lag 5%.  Blacks by 11%.  Yeah, we predominantly see white faces as the front of the anti gay movement, but remember, we live in America and that is who has the loudest and largest voice. Rich, white, Male, Christian.  One also might wonder how things like age, education, income may figure in to the numbers.  Would they causes statistical skew and error?  Say for instance, a survey is done electronically.  I would imagine older and poorer people might underrepresented in the data.	1

Not at all. There was widespread opinion on that QB class. It’s easy to point and laugh at the Bears now, but experts were very split on those guys at the time and it wasn’t surprising to see Trubisky go first.

"Solidarity isn't ""abstaining from taking a test""; it would be requisitioning tests from the wealthy or funding the manufacture of test kits for distribution by and for the people  We need to be addressing the inadequate living conditions for working people around the world and here by addressing a for-profit infrastructure.

If we're just blindly inserting prime 1st peat MJ into the equation statistically, he wins any close series LeBron ever had:   LeBron choked in 2007, 2011, 2013, 2015. His average finals were 2012 and 2016, while best by far was 2014.   MJ loses 2017-2018. If we just insert MJ's stats for LeBron's he easily wins 2016 finals against an injured Warriors team. He might even win 2015 finals as well when you look at LeBron's inefficiency (47% TS) compared to 60%+ that MJ always had. The 2014 is a tossup. We all know 2013 was completely luck based and LeBron didn't play well at all until game 7 and average in game 4/6, so MJ gets this as well. 2012 MJ gets it. 2011 I would probably say yes. 2007 was a horrible finals by LeBron - 22  pts 42% TS - and they had 2 close games. So at the very least MJ takes that series to 6.   Again, all dumb hypothetical since MJ's stats would look quite different with the rules changing.	0

"> You do realize that teams have an opportunity to offer an extension before a player hits Free Agency right?  That's how the NBA works.  I get that you're new to this.  The Celtics DIDN'T offer an extension.  Not that they couldn't, they simply didn't.  They moved on from Kyrie and his toxic personality. You claimed that they ""waited"" for Kyrie and moved on to Kemba. Now you're admitting that you made that up?  [According to Lowe, the Boston Celtics would have offered star point guard Kyrie Irving an extension last fall “but rules capped Irving’s first-year salary in such a deal at 120% of his 2018-19 salary — well short of what he stood to make by entering unrestricted free agency.” As a result, the Celtics knew that it would be all but impossible to convince Irving to sign the extension, a scenario that’s a common happenstance in the NBA.](https://celticswire.usatoday.com/2019/07/24/report-celtics-would-have-offered-kyrie-irving-an-extension-last-fall/)   Let me guess, Zach Lowe is lying too?  > You've provided 0 facts.  You clearly don't know what a fact even means.  Kyrie Irving being on a completely different tier than DLo, as well as an actual professional basketball team choosing Kyrie over DLo as recently as this summer isn’t an opinion. It’s a fact."	0

These things are compatible   100% agreed that Asian people have faced tons of racism in the US as well. The Chinese Exclusion Act is one of the best examples, where the full weight of the government was placed behind a racist policy. Or the internment camps during world war II   Also agreed that things are more difficult to parse out between some Asian countries. Still, there are lasting scars from things like the Rape of Nanking and Japanese occupation of South Korea that give an extra heft to discrimination between those groups.    I'm not an expert and don't claim to be - still, it seems clear to me that historical injustices and current power dynamics are the key differences between discrimination and racism.	0

I wouldn't say that. Auto-rotation in essence is just using airflow through the blades to give them energy, since the blades are being given energy it also means the fall is retarded. On approach to the ground the pilot changes the angle of the blades to generate lift and this quickly depletes the inertial energy built up. Too soon and you run out of energy and begin falling, and land with excessive speed (crash). Too late and you don't retard your fall enough and crash. There are also a lot more conditions and failures that can prevent a successful auto-rotation.	1

Regardless of what you think of his policies, it is a fact that his ideals haven't changed since he came into politics and he has tirelessly fought for things that seem normal now (black rights, gay rights etc) that were controversial, to say the least, when he was fighting for them.

It doesn’t fall under the homophobic category but the thing about that Marcus Morris feminine quote last month that stood out was how willing and unhesitant he was to say something like that on record publicly.

I actually did answer his question just in another comment chain right below it. And just for the record you shouldn't brush off what are very clear signs of mental unease in your comments.  A living wage is one in which a person working 40 hours a week can afford all the necessities (shelter, clothing, a phone, health care, etc.) as well as have enough left over at the end of the month for an emergency fund (so that you can actually take a breath that isn't tainted by the pressure of wondering what happens if you miss just one paycheck and maybe not be terrified about your financial situation every waking second).   THAT is a living wage. It will be different depending on the state and even city, and not everyone will be diligent about saving, but what I outlined isn't outrageous or impossible.	1

He was known for getting to work early and putting in extra data entry before his day even started, so I decided I'd show up at 5am and impress him. I figured I'd easily be there first.  So I manage to roll in at 5am, and when I got there I see one desk lamp on. I walked over and saw him just entering crosstab after crosstab. I couldn't believe it. He was drenched in sweat and didn't even acknowledge my presence. The cleaning crew was there, and when I asked them, they said he'd been there since 3am just crunching numbers. What a legend. He truly Excelled in anything he put his mind to.	1

again im with you with regards to gender identity. But your point specifically was that they always knew their real identity back to when they are preteens. My point is that, that's not always the case. In fact it can be an extremely drawn out and complicated process to reach that conclusion. You mention that the people who have transitioned said that, but what about all the people who thought about transitioning as a kid but changed their mind as an adult? You can't really get their perspective on this.	1

Jackson would get fired in less than 2 seasons. Legendary coaches ride the backs of their Great players. Lebron wouldn't give jackson a chance to implement any type of system. Coaching doesn't get brought up because lebron had more than several chances to play for great coaches and he chose henchmen, that wouldn't ruffle his LeFeathers too much. He's a cancer when it comes to playing in a space and system where he is not ball dominant and stat padding. It would never work.	0

Nobody is saying they exploited all of their workers.

Dwight was amazing OFF the ball or on the pick and roll. But he had no really offensive moves with the ball in hand.   His foot work was mediocre at best, and his only move was this shoulder drop-then-spear that should been called for an offensive foul more often than it was.   We actually saw that in the NBA finals when Gasol was taking the bump/charge on that move and the officials actually started calling it after Phil Jackson made a point of mentioning in a post-game interview (taking the fine for criticizing the officials).   The issue was that Dwight simply wasn't the kind of guy who had the offensive tools to average 25+ a game, but he wanted to be in the conversation with Shaq, Hakeem, and Wilt, not Mourning and Mutumbo. So he wanted more touches, and more time in the post, and SVG woulldn't give it to him (and for good reason).   Which soured his relationship with Orlando.   Then Dwight didn't want to run the pick-and-roll in LA and got stuck with an offensive coach who didn't care about D.   But even on defense, there were times when Dwight would do that volleyball spike. I felt like it was just because it looked good. He could have tipped those down and kept position instead of giving the ball back to the other team out of bounds.   He was great to watch, but those highlights are misleading. They show his athleticism at its best.	0

Bro. No. Just stop. *some* players do better in the playoffs *sometimes.* overwhelmingly every player averages less in the playoffs than they do in the regular season for a multitude of fairly obvious reasons that have clearly flown over your head. I'm done using stats because you're incapable of interpreting them. In any case, learn how the sport works before you come back. It's embarrassing.	0

Imagine putting Kobe in your top 10 let alone top 5. This guy is easily the most overrated player of all time and the morons put him there solely cuz he won 5 rings which is irrelevant cuz sports are scripted. If you base it solely off achievements, he is no where near top 10. Try doing research instead of listening to the paid shills AKA media. Media says Kobe is clutch yet if you look up his clutch stats, he shot 27% in the clutch which is terrible. Media D rode this guy for whatever reason. Must be cuz he played for LA	0

This. Even with KLove’s and Irving’s defendive shortcomings, these three created historic offenses. The narrative of “James making Love less effective” would be looked at completely differently had Love/Kyrie not been injured in 2015 and had KD not joined the Warriors in 2017.  In 2015, when they had some defenders (e.g., Shumpert who played was defending like a top 5 defensive wing),they could play both offense and defense. In their last 36 games together, they went 33-3 and had an SRS around +14 to +15.  2016 playoffs: +13 SRS (top 5 playoffs offense)  2017 playoffs: +14 SRS (best raw playoffs offense)  These are all time numbers, but sadly for them, the KD Added Turbo Warriors came about.  Take a look at these pairings:  Kobe/Shaq, +9.1, +10.9, +8.4, +10.1 in ‘01, ‘02, ‘03, ‘04 respectively; KD/Westbrook, +12.8 in 2016, +10.6 in 2015, +7.5 in 2014, +10.8 in 2013, +7.0 in 2012, +2.6 in 2011, +5.8 in 2010  James With Love, 2016,+12.0  James With Love, 2015, +11.8  James With Kyrie, 2015, +11.0  James With Kyrie, 2017, +10.2  James With Love, 2017, +10.1  Those are better numbers than the numbers Shaq and Kobe paired to put together. How can that be a failed pairing?  Lastly, about Love being “marginalized.” If you use a player to create an all time offense, how is he being marginalized?  2014 “Minny Love” per 100 possessions as a first option  35.4/17 on 59.1% TS  2017 Cavs’ Love per 100 possessions as a third option  30.2/17.6 on 57.3% TS (took 2.1 fewer FGA/g per 100–equalize FGA and he’s at 32.6 ppg per 100 possessions)  2018 Cavs’ Love per 100 possessions as a second option  30.8/16.2 on 61.4% TS (took 3.5 fewer FGA/g per 100–equalize FGA and he’s at 35.1 ppg AS A SECOND OPTION, almost identical to Minny Love as a FIRST OPTION; of course, with 3.5 more FGA per game, he’d basically be a co-first option with Bron)  All time playoff offensive series   Here’s a list of the best offensive series in NBA history (over the last 44 years at least); the Cavs have 5 of the top 29, i.e., 50% of all Cavs’ playoff series since 2016 began have been in the top 1% of all playoff series played. They also have two best ever.  Cavs 2017 vs. Celtics, 128.4  Cavs 2018 vs. Raptors, 127.3  Suns 1995 vs. Blazers, 127.3  Bulls 1992 vs. Miami, 126.7  Lakers 1987 vs. Nuggets, 125.1  Suns 2005 vs. Grizzlies, 124.8  Lakers 1985 vs. Suns, 124.6  Lakers 1988 vs. Mavs, 124.6  Lakers 2010 vs. Suns, 124.2  Magic 1996 vs. Pistons, 123.7  Magic 1996 vs. Hawks, 123.1  Cavs 2016 vs. Hawks, 122.9  Lakers 1986 vs. Spurs, 122.7  Thunder 2016 vs. 122.5  Lakers 1989 vs. Blazers, 122.4  Warriors 2017 vs. Spurs, 122.2  Lakers 1984 vs. Mavs, 121.9  Jazz 1997 vs. Clippers, 121.7  Lakers 1987 vs. Warriors, 121.7  Bulls 1991 vs. Pistons, 121.6  Celtics 1986 vs. Bulls, 121.4  Warriors 2017 vs. Cavs, 121.3  Spurs 2017 vs. Memphis, 121.0  Bulls 1993 vs. Hawks, 121.0  Spurs 2014 vs. Miami, 120.8  Rockets 1995 vs. Jazz, 120.6  Cavs 2016 vs. Pistons, 120.4  Cavs 2017 vs. Raptors, 120.3  Magic 1995 vs. Pacers, 120.2	0

This is spoken like someone whose never had to deal with anything like this in their lives.  The reason many women feel the way they do about Kobe - or someone accused of these things - is they have seen and lived the real life consequences of these actions.

Yes.  Inbound pass and dude shoots the 3 from full court literally every time.  Doesn't have to play defense, he would get roughly 60 or 70 shots due to that alone and would make 100% of them, getting to between 180 and 210.  Even with only 4 capable defenders on the court, teams at best would make like 60% of their shots and lose	0

So the spurs outnumbered the Heat in 2014?  Really?  I mean, I guess 15>3.    And, yes, we agree that Lebron choked.  But with your username you should realize that the scheme that the Mavs employed on Lebron in that series had him choking.  Any time he was able to get around his man on the perimeter he was met in the lane by the Mavs zone.  The Mavs have publicly said that they wanted to just make him a passer and that's exactly what happened.  So give some credit to the Mavs braintrust while acknowledging the choke job.  (Oh, and I just watched a bunch of that finals.  Kidd did a masterful job of bodying Lebron.)	0

"I tried to explain that to them but they seemed to just nod their heads and then change the subject. It's annoying that they're dismissive, I don't know if they realize that roughly half my male friends are gay. it definitely hurt to hear them say that, but to me it sounded like it was from a place of ignorance not hatred if that makes sense. They specifically called it ""weird"" and weren't as intense as banning it from discussion. I genuinely think they just don't understand it because all they understand is heterosexual relationships. They were also an arranged marriage which reinforces this idea. Being gay in Indian culture just barely started to be socially acceptable and it's all due to western television and entertainment. It'll change with our generation, it already has."	1

Yep see that’s the problem with Reddit. You’re all on here pleasuring each other and looking for acceptance and illogically expect the same from everyone else; fantasizing about the world being peaceful and kind when it’s not absolute like that. I’m free to say whatever I want even if it doesn’t live up to your expectation. Redditors like you think you’ve got everything and everyone figured out and that everyone lives by your soft, majority-rule, social standards. And your only defense mechanism is flipping the script and pointing out “irony” so a bunch of faceless geeks back you up. Congratulations. But your problem is I, on the other hand, do not give a fuck about any of you or what any of you think. So I am content with coming off as douchey, immature, or whatever. It’s a risk I’ll take to possibly stop seeing stupid garbage like this pussy live stream. Call it arrogance, cockiness, confidence, judgy, or whatever. If I wanna call you a pussy then I will and it doesn’t matter what age I am. You’re a pussy, and all of you people are pussies! End of story. Fuck you gonna do about it. I see no irony. But glad it’s entertaining for you and you have more content to fuel a circle jerk with everyone on here. Bc all I really see is a bunch of butthurt Redditors that didn’t get accepted by 100% of the site users and their safespace got invaded against their best wishes.

First of all, no one is making any comparison but you; I only brought up Harden because no one else would make the same defense for Harden, making op's entire statement hypocritical. Second, Doncic flops a ton and I like how you just casually waive the fact that he's 5th in the league. He also has a very good fta per fga/drive ratio, not to mention 9.1 fta per 20.4 FGA which is extremely high even if it doesn't quite reach Harden levels.	1

No thats nowhere near a realistic portrayal of the situation. This virus kills the old and already sick, for the absolute majority it will be similar to a flu. Mass unemployment and a deep depression is much more dangerous. And your second point is just ridiculous. Tens of millions are living in poverty, and they are barely covered by benefits. Imagine if 50 million more people become unemployed and now will rely on the government for food and housing. Thats the real societal collapse, not a flu that kills the old and frail mostly. Sure the virus will cause many people to need to stay home just like during a regular flu, but after 1-2 weeks those people will have recovered and hopefully have immunity.  You and everyone else here are doing exactly what that guy warned against, which is to buy into the panic and act in stupid emotional ways. The only solution is the vaccine, and no country can stay locked down for more than 3 months.	1

I mean she had advocated for almost entirely the same policies as Bernie for the past ~15 years, while directly opposing many of Bidens policies so whether or not you think Bernie defines true progressivism it'd be pretty damn hard to argue she didn't go back against many of her longly held (or I guess stated is more accurate) beliefs. Policies her and Bernie both advocated for while Biden has not and will not include: legalizing weed, enacting a wealth tax, ending fracking, getting rid of superpacs/ large money donors influence in politics, getting rid of superdelegates, cover everyone on govt run health insurance and eliminate private insurance, consider a job guarantee, focus deportations only on criminals and security threats, make college free etc etc. She was loudly anti superpac but then cashed a 14.5 mil check from one silicon valley exec while claiming Bernie had superpacs (because a youth led climate action group and a nurses union chose to endorse him and gave him pennies compared to Liz's superpac, and are funded by small donations which are completely dif than being funded by a few extremely rich donors that you're then beholden too) and had been very anti super delegates going against the will of the people only until she knew she couldn't win a majority and decided she actually was okay with that if it meant her having a chance when her campaign was all but dead. And whether you think Bernie defines progressivism he was the only other progressive in the race and she willingly chose to attack him again and again, like when she all of a sudden got mad at him for something he supposedly said 8 months prior (while remaining on friendly terms with him in the interim) and loudly condemning Bernie again and again claiming he needs to be responsible for every anonymous Twitter account that says anything mean (which he did in fact denounce) while doing nothing to denounce her supporters saying heinous shit on there constantly as well. If random people tweeting snake emojis at you for you going back on things you've claimed to believe in for years is enough to not support the only candidate left in the race that had similar policiess, I think it's fair to say Warren doesn't actually give a shit about the things she's claimed to for all these years and it's pretty hard to make a case she's progessive after her actions had a huge contribution in stiffling any chance of a progessive movement making any real strides	0
Here is a question for you? Have you followed what any other countries are doing?  Because Canada is offering people $2000 a month, plus Canadians have health care and aren’t reliant on insurance.  Canada also has it so you can’t travel across provinces too, and stay at home orders in every location.   The growth of covid in the states is increasing faster than any other country and has been for about 2 weeks. It isn’t going to slow down either.  It is hilarious how ignorant you are if you think that the trump administration has been doing a good job preparing for this. You need to compare your country vs other countries, not what Trump has done vs other presidents who have never faced an epidemic. I’m glad you enjoy my username, it represents people like you!	0

Please stfu. Kyrie got injured in game 1 of 2015 finals and warriors won in overtime. Lebron and the cavs won games 2 and 3 in that series and were 2-1 up. Immediately the warriors figured it out and made adjustments he started complaining that he had no help. Lebron losst 3 straight games after going 2-1 up without kyrie and love. Even steve kerr said they didnt believe they could win it. He lost to an inexperienced team and yet said he didnt have help. He was supposed to be the chosen one and lost to a team led by an undersized 7th pick who was said to have tissue paper ankles..	0

Well, we are constantly changing words and name because it has racist connotation. For example here in Sweden we had a pastry that was called n****boll, but around 90's, the n-word started to have a racist connotation here because of the similarity between it and the English word(mostly because of American movies and TV show). So now its called chokladboll.   So, if it really is so racist as some claim, its not pointless to change the name of the Spanish flu..	0
Lol how can you come even close to pinpointing a recovery rate when a majority of the cases are going undiagnosed including mine? Those are a bunch of hypotheticals. We could fluke up and find a cure next week even thought that’s extremely unlikely. And I would hope the retirement homes and vectors would make a attempt to quarantine the employees and give them guides to follow. It seems to be like most people recover within a week so just give the employees frequent tests and if they test positive don’t let them return until they beat it. Probably who we should be testing rn instead of NBA players and other celebrities who feel fine. And I might be overestimating it but I still feel as if us as human beings went out of are way to check on them and assist them they’d make it through just fine and we could survive without a possible economic crash.	0

I honestly think some of them care a lot about fans, but the majority don't give a fuck. I got to meet Kobe Bryant IRL and he couldn't have been cooler to everyone there.

To act like Roy wouldn't put up a fight is absolutely ridiculous. Roy embarassed the light heavyweight division so bad that he had to move up to heavyweight and then dominated the heavyweight champ at the time, who had beaten Evander Holyfield before that.  I think Tyson would've won with both in their primes, simply because you can't make up 40 pounds in the ring like that and Roy was a super middleweight originally for Christ's sake, but to act like he wouldn't be able to do anything is pure fantasy, Roy went years without losing ROUNDS.  In 2003, it's not even a debate, you clearly don't know or ignore how bad Tyson looked against Lennox Lewis and how awful he was at this point of his career compared to his former self, so awful that he got knocked out by Danny fucking Williams.	0

But I'm talking about ,total point gap. My argument is yes Shaq got 1 vote less than unanimous but won by a much bigger margin of total points which is all that matters.

Reggie Miller. I can't believe nobody has mentioned him yet. Dude was one of the first I ever saw doing it as a shooter and getting far in the playoffs. He dared to even get to the NBA Finals and hang 2 games up on Shaq and Kobe at the beginning of their 3 peat. One of the few who pushed Jordan to 7 games in a series. I'm not sure that anyone besides Detroit did that. In an era dominated by big centers and forwards, he was the first straight up shooter type to be winning 50-60+ games with his shooting style being the dominant threat. He was a tough SOB too and I think he'd tear this league up right now. He was always a playoff performer and is one of the few that turned up his play in the playoffs. He didn't average 40ppg like MJ did, but Reggie had a playoff gear where other guys just simply did not.	0

Ignore. Just ignore.      Resume the season immediately. NBA should never suspend/cancel the season. The league should never waste another year of prime LeBron.

If no team is going to wanna play, just give him MVP and just give the Lakers a title. They already beat Bucks & Clippers, so at this point NOBODY would have any doubt Lakers deserve the trophy anyways.	0

What do they do if an outbreak develops while they're at this 'neutral' location?  All you need is for one person to test positive and that'll more than send people into a frenzy. It's not as simple as just quarantining them.  If an NBA player tests positive, it means they've had it at least for 2-14 days (since it seems we're only testing people when exhibiting symptoms) and could've spread it to anyone within that time period. That means family, coaches, teammates, other players - who will all need to be tested now.   The optics of this is absolutely horrible for the NBA - wasting limited test kits so that basketball can finish this season is absurd. And if it's a 'neutral' city that develops an outbreak because the NBA moved there, the perception of the NBA would become worse than the NFL	0

Like I said, I only wanted to point out that saying journalists need to be spoonfed information is asinine. It's not like they don't know about the seriousness of the situation, they have Chinese correspondents for crying out loud. On top of that their job description is to literally do research and not just trust everything someone tells them.

">Yet another monumentally moronic quote. Literally no GM thinks this way. They are doing their best to build contending teams. And you can find players capable of being good first options without being ""a top 5 player"". It's an asinine argument that you continue to make, and continue to be dead wrong on.  Prove it, history doesn't lie, they build with the best players they can get, there is always a 1-5% chance they can win without a top 5 player or one of their players develops into a top 5 talent due to being young. Keep ignoring statistics though. Why do you think the 3 favourites this year all have top 5 players on them? ofc teams like Miami, Boston etc could get to the ECF, but there is a tiny chance they win, its literally 3/40(if you are generous and count dirk and wade)  >I've said plenty, and refuted almost every one of your moronic arguments.

I agree.  A 400 DL is chicken shit any HS kid finished with puberty can do within 6 mos of training.   500 is something someone with  average ability can train to.  If he trained for he, he would DL in the 700s at least, but considering he's playing bball, ill say 455 bench, kevin durant benched 315,  mid 600 DL, 500 to 600 sq if it's a full range squat, a lot more in a powerlifting style squat to parallel.   These are conservative.  He could play on an nfl defensive line.  Throw bball player numbers out the window, he isnt built like a basketball player.	0

I'm not entirely sure why you did that racial breakdown, but okay, yep, those are accurate numbers.  The margin of error I'm referring to is about the true mean of the population, not the one individual data point in 2019. Due to the small difference in this number (4%), and the fact that the lead has shifted since as recent as 2014 and the parity at around 2016-2017, AND the fact that in a different poll I found Hispanics were actually 1% higher than whites in gay marriage acceptance (in my other comment), it's not really possible to say whether Hispanics or whites  are more accepting of gay marriage.   Your other concerns are speculation that would need to be borne out by actual evidence. Pew is a reasonably reputable source and I'm not willing to grant you this point. I can easily conceive that white people would be LESS likely to say that they were against gay marriage than Hispanic people on a poll, so the survey may actually overestimate support on whites for any variety of reasons. You have decent logic about people not willing to say they are against gay marriage, but why would Hispanic people be less willing to say that? You can come up with any reason you want but it's going to be even more speculative and untethered by evidence.  Your last problem is indicative of the problem in your modality of thinking. You've already presupposed that people of color are more homophobic, and because the evidence shows that this is not true for AAPI or Hispanics, you question the data. Would you be questioning the data if it showed like 40% numbers for Hispanics and AAPI? If you're being honest with yourself, I would guess not (but I'm not going to say for certain as that's presumptuous).	1

And more importantly, why do you need to play JV  basketball to understand the nuances of the sport? Surely if their analysis is so bad, you'd be able to rebut it.  > you gotta bunch of kids    You know their age how?   > everyone else on the team sucks and that player is a volume scorer.   Ohhh, now I get it. You have zero clue how these analytics work. Many stats ***dont*** get inflated with volume scoring. Some prefer players who score less. Now all of what you've said makes sense. You don't know what you're talking about so you're tryna feel yourself by attacking the credibility of people you feel stupider then.   &#x200B;  It's really simple, if someone doesn't know  enough, then you should be able to take apart their arguments.

Now that's actually a good question! I would argue that Trump failed to put the right people in charge. Those people failed to set proper expectations with the leaders of specific departments, namely ones that were keeping track of the spread of COVID-19. Those departments probably have about 5 or 6 layers of management before you get to the people with actual boots on the ground. Those people have probably been with the agency for 10-20 years and never thought COVID would get this crazy, and there's 10,000 policies and procedures for reporting to upper management, so the feedback loop from top to bottom of the organization was bad. Compound that with Trump saying it's not a big deal and you've got a cluster on your hands.   1. Setting the wrong people in charge was Trumps fault.   2. Having poor bureaucracy from people actually doing the work in the agency is a systemic problem with any public organization worth billions of dollars.	1

Here's WHO's recommendation to avoid naming it after geographic groups (among other criteria) https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2015/naming-new-diseases/en/  Honestly, I can't believe we are even having this conversation. It should really take a quantum of empathy to realize why these names should be avoided, especially considering that (a) we already have both other names that have been widely accepted, and (b) I could see Wuhan Coronavirus (though I'd avoid it), but Chinese Virus doesn't even many sense--we don't refer to Ebola by The Congo Virus.  It's quite obvious what Trump is doing. He's trying to distract from his failings by sowing resentment against China. And I'd say M.O. involves primarily sowing racial resentment. That's not surprising, given it's a trick that worked in 2016.  But I hate it. That press conference today was simply gross.

This guy is a pure hater but i get it. It must be hard watching him raw dog your team in the playoffs. Curry is the reason Harden doesnt have a ring.. Saying he didnt change anything is false. People  were skeptical about shooting 3s because analysts like charles barkley got them believing that no jump shooting team could win a title. Curry's success winning  shooting jumpshots was a validation and it blew up.   Lets address curry getting carried by his team mates. Tell me now that draymond would have been an all star if he played with harden, westbrook, cp3 ,lebron or any other elite player. Draymond'soffensive game relies on curry getting double teamed. Klay is a 41.9% 3pt shooter for his career. When curry leaves the floor, data has shown that percentage to drop to 38%. Have u ever seen klay get double teamed?. Klay is a great player but he still doesnt know how to split a double team till today because curry get all the attention. 2019 finals curry got double teamed, triple teamed, boxed and 1 while klay had single coverage on lowry who he just posted up all series. Warriors never lost because curry choked. They lost because nobody else stepped up. Curry averaged 30ppg in the finals. More than kwahi's 28ppg but raptors had 6 players that averaged double figures in that finals while warriors had just 3. Klay 26ppg and draymond 11ppg.. Tell me what iguodala and livingston achieved before joining the warriors.       Kd was known as MR Unreliable in okc because his efficiency reduced drastcally in the post season. Now he went to golden state and his efficiency skyrocketed. Kd had the most efficient years of his playoff career at golden state. Recorded his highest FG% with the warriors. Data also showed that kd became less efficient with curry off the floor. Which is why they were barely above 500 with kd and no Curry.   Curry became an allstar and an all nba player before steve kerr got there despite being snubbed a year prior. Draymond was still a bench player when curry became an all star and klay wasnt this Klay.  Im trying to understand where your notion of getting carried by team mates came from. Steph has averaged more ppg than all those team mates except kd in every season and every playoff. And dont forget he beat kd fair and square in 2016 playoffs..   Lets address the elite playmaking issue. Curry was averaging 8.5assists per game under mark jackson when he was a ball dominant guard. Steve kerr convinced him to get off ball more for the team to be more unpredictable which he did. Even Doc rivers mentioned this in a press conference. Curry is selfless and doesnt play for stats which is why they always win.Can anyone tell CP3 to give up the ball? 75% of Draymond's assists are hockey assists of curry's passes and he doesnt care. Look at the 2018 houston series, games 5, 6 and 7 curry was posting 8 and 9 apg because kerr made him ball dominant when the series was about to slip away.         Lets talk about handles. Curry's handles are elite and very efficient. He used to do elaborate handles back in the days but rarely does them now because its better to driblle less while other shooters go cold.Curry and kd had identical usage in their 3yrs together. Kd never had usage close to westbrook in any season they played together. Kyrie has better handles agreed but he prefers to dribble around while shooters go cold. You have to be living under a rock not to know that kyrie's presence has never made any team better. Tatum regressed last year because of kyrie and dinwiddle is up for a down year next year when kyrie returns.. Harden doesnt have better handles than curry. Curry handles in motion while harden dribbles life out of the shot clock at one spot..  Replace harden with curry on that rockets team and i swear  they have more success.Curry makes his teammmates better than harden can ever imagine..	0

That playoff run was everything. Not only did Dirk play out of his mind all playoffs, but he got revenge against the same team that broke his heart 5 years earlier in the finals and he did it by spearheading one of the greatest comebacks ever in game 2. The general consensus among nba fans was that Dirk would retire without a ring, that he was soft. It was incredible seeing him finally come through and putting all that to bed. The sad thing is he should have been in the mix more afterwards. If Cuban doesn’t split up that team the following season I think they’re repeating or at least competing. One of the biggest misconceptions about the 2011 Mavs was that it was some sort of fluke. That’s false, that team was really really good especially defensively and Tyson Chandler was the heart and soul of that defence and the perfect big to play next to Dirk. I don’t understand the decision to let him go.	0

"First of all, Kobe's death has nothing to do with difficulty running the league. Yes the China thing was difficult but the NBA as a whole, at least the way Silver has ""run"" it, is much easier. Let the players do whatever they want (i.e. constantly demanding trades) then lament about the players doing whatever they want, make a bunch of political PR statements and fans eat it up, your on-court product is terrible but fans don't care.

If I had to guess it’s because Hockey cares even more about masculinity than basketball does. The culture is all about being tough and masculine, not letting an injury keep you out of the game, dudes are literally allowed to fight each other, etc.   I also read an article where they were saying that hockey is more of a team first game that has less focus on individualism and that players would feel like they’re disrupting the team and causing a distraction by airing out their personal lives. I can see this as there are far fewer personalities in the NHL than there are in the NBA or even the NFL.	1

I don't know how the salary cap works for the NBA, but in the world of rugby the Saracens (UK rugby team) just got relegated by their governing body for something similar.

Because the dudes extremely racist towards asians  Edit:  really downvoted?  On February 28, 2001, an Asian American Golden State Warriors’ fan named Michael Ching shouted at Jason (who was playing for the Sacramento Kings) to “get used to sitting on the bench.” However, the third-year NBA player lashed back with immensely inappropriate and racist comments, including, “I’ll shoot all you Asian mother——-. Do you remember the Vietnam War? I’ll shoot all ya’ll like that.” That is after asking Ching if he was a “fag” and calling him a “slant eyed mother——.”   Asshole literally have to give an public apology for being racist and was fined, but I guess its just ok if its against asians, it is reddit after all so he fits in well here  [Source](https://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/williams-apologizes-for-slurs-1.260572)	0

This is why this sub will never be a viable place for analysis of basketball. People want to scream and bitch in their comments everytime the team they hates benefits. The fact no one wants to mention Theiss constantly hooking AD under the basket or the tick tacky fouls that brought the Celtics into the game says everything. Both teams had a missed goaltend. The JB call was bullshit. Just because only the bad calls are being posted for one team doesn't tell the story of the full 48 minutes. Anyone that understands basketball and watched 48 minutes would undoubtedly know that this game was in no way decided by referees.	1

Amar'e can suck a nut. He is only aware when the issue affects how people view HIM. I had a convo with him on IG.

He ended the convo on a polite note, but I realized a year later he blocked me lol	1
Instead of wasting your time watching old videos of a sport that won’t be around until we can repopulate enough to bring back modern infrastructure, you need to get your things in order while we still have electricity, gas, and modern day mass communications.

I was going to respond to one of your comments in another thread last night about educating yourself before speaking as if fact, but I refrained from doing so. Now I know for damn sure you're just talking out of your ass.  There is an NBA-specific study out there if you actually look. Most players are at full efficiency 1 year after the surgery. The biggest con is the small chance of re-injury, but there have been plenty that have not.   FYI... some guy named Scottie Pippen had the same surgery to start his NBA career. He turned out alright, I think.	1

Of course, when we made the decision, we felt that while Game Threads are very much the same game to game (title straight forward, body straight forward, posted an hour before tip). Post Game Threads are where the community can be involved and add a little flavor. The other benefit, is the most reliable way for a bot to know when a game is done is through the NBA API, which for timing purposes is not always consistent, and results in a delay in posting, which human posters do not have that issue. This is one of the reasons why we have mods post the Post Game Threads during the playoffs, when a place to have instant reactions are in high demand. So basically we felt there were enough benefits to leaving PGTs as is to warrant leaving them alone. Obviously this is an issue, that is possible, and while we've encountered before, it was pretty limited in occurrences, so if we can maintain that, that would be ideal.	1

I am saying of the **top rebounders in the NBA** and you're comparing Giannis' rebounding statistics to Lebron, Harden, and Westbrook?  &#x200B;  Top 5 Rebounders:  &#x200B;  Drummond @ 15. 8 REB  Gobert @ 14.6 REB  Whiteside @ 14 REB  Capela @ 13.8 REB  Giannis @ 13.4 REB  [https://stats.nba.com/players/rebounding/?sort=REB&dir=1](https://stats.nba.com/players/rebounding/?sort=REB&dir=1)  &#x200B;  Top 5 Contested Rebounders:  &#x200B;  Drummond @ 7.3 C.

Of the top 5 rebounders, Giannis is by far the lowest in both the contested and offensive rebounding categories. Giannis is #5 in total rebounds, #16 at contested rebounds, and #29 at offensive rebounds. Compare that to Drummond who is #1 in all 3 categories, Capela who is #4 total rebounds, #3 contested, and #2 offensive, etc.	1

He did, and he did so more than Pippen.  Contrary to popular opinion, Michael Jordan – not Scottie Pippen –   most often drew the opposition’s toughest perimeter assignment. However,  it was close: Jordan did so 8 times, while Scottie Pippen assumed this  responsibility 7 times.     ***After reviewing the game film from the  1991 NBA Finals, it turns out the Jordan – not Pippen – guarded Magic  Johnson for nearly 85-90% of that series. The exception was the first  half of Game 2 and the 2H of Game 3.***     **Out of 24 playoff  series, Michael Jordan – not Scottie Pippen -guarded the better   perimeter player more often. Specifically,Jordan guarded the better  perimeter player during 13 playoff series, while Pippen guarded the  better perimeter player 11 times.**     So Pippen only guarded  Magic for 2 halves....and yet most people think he guarded him most of  the series. Its amazing what some highlights, reputation, and word of  mouth can do.     I would say 1998 is a tie tho, I know Reggie was the Pacers best player but Pippen guarded Mark Jackson which was crucial....     But still it is a HUGE myth that Pippen mostly guarded the other teams best player.	0

Yes? Youre not thinking clearly if you think otherwise.  Exposing more people to corona means that they get it and it goes away after some time and develop immunity/resistance to it, or in some cases they die.   If we wanted corona to pass over faster then we would've never quarantined, however it would also put a huge strain on hospitals and it would result in way more deaths so obviously it wouldnt be the smartest idea to do that.	0

First of all, I was just pointing out that the guy I responded to is simply spreading misinformation that quarantine will result in this pandemic passing over faster. I never said itd be better to have more deaths so that we can get over this faster.  Second of all, no, we shouldnt try to keep the number of cases as low as possible as that would extend this pandemic too long to the point that the economy is absolutely tanked and the resulting fallout is even worse. The real goal is to find the perfect point where the total deaths of the impact of corona and a decline in the economy is at its lowest.	0
I don't get why people think guy is some lowkey douche. I remember watching a player tribune video and guy seemed like a very well-spoken and geniune dude. Maybe he has faults and could seem immature but it doesn't seem he is some POS person. It's why I laugh at the arrogant Jimmy Butler fanboys thinking KAT is not some good hearted person. I really feel bad for his loss man.  I'm done with people being entitled in America. It's not just about taking things seriosuly but just understnading the situation. Many people complain about how much these lockdowns are hurting many people and I aree. We can't expect to lockdown America for so long, but we need to get people hve already and can be affected by this and it's not good. It's why I wish people just stopped panicking like the babies in r/coronovirus making everything seemed like the end of the world and people at /unpopularopinion saying this virus is a joke and that everything should cater ot people who won't bve affected and going to malllies and getting dollies for my baby girl is more important.    That's to any conservativesliving in POS joke states like Alabmama, Florida, Texas, and whatever white KK hotspots GO FUCK YOURSELF. This applies to you baby insecure SJWs living in California. If oyu don't like republicnas or democrats just don't ever go these states or care about them. I'm never going to shitty states that have KKK activity like georgia or North Carolina cause I know there will be some sort of racism so I don't give a fuck.   I don't care if KAT is a celebrity, his mother fuckin died and seemed like a average American. Fuck America at times. Hope people just take things seriosuly and just look towards getting things done SOON. We could possibly get this under control, we should always have faith. The season can literally restart in 2020. But just do THINGS NOW. Americans are super entitled and the reason why KAT mothers died is because AMerica will never be united. America's culture is like a thrid world country tbh. It's honestly sad. Feel bad for good Americans like me but many want to play poltiics.	0

Tyson lost to Buster Douglas and to Holyfield. People excuse it by saying he didn’t take the Douglas fight seriously and that if he didn’t go to prison he would have beaten Holyfield, but that’s all speculation. A lot of Ali’s biggest fights happened after his boxing license was taken away from him during his prime. By then he’d notably lost a lot of the movement and speed that he had in his prime, but he still managed to beat all the heavyweights of his era. I’m not saying Tyson wasn’t a great fighter, but to me it feels like people overrate him because of the mysticism that surrounded him. Especially Americans.	0

If you read enough history you see this pattern over and over and over again. Concentrated wealth leads to revolution or collapse if it's not met with regulation first. Wealth distribution in the US today resembles that of historical societies on the brink and it's only been accelerating in that direction. With some luck it will only be a wave of political revolution and not violence, but that depends on the ultra wealthy being accountable to law.	0

"You seriously think Kobe is top 15? He's not even close, look at advanced stats for a second, if you're smart enough to understand them I mean.  Let me put down my classwork for my Advanced Applications in Statistics class at MIT Open Courseware for a second to teach you a little something about how mathematical models work. You probably couldn't even begin to comprehend how the models I work on in my spare time work, but I'll try anyway. It's good to pass on the knowledge, especially to those who are not well endowed in the analytical side of things.  You must be one of those Lakers fans that thinks championships are actually important, completely ignorant to the fact that any legendary player (Duncan anyone?) would take a 55 FG% than some useless jewelry ring anyday.  You don't know anything about the PER valuations and the metrics used to accentuate intricate sample sets about autonomous principles that can be extracted to show that Kobe Bryant has never actually hit a game winner in his career. All his game winners are media hype tapes to sell shoes. Kobe is very fortunate that he's marketed so well by Nike and the Lakers franchise.  ESPN and the whole 'next Jordan' narrative has you thinking Kobe is clutch but he's not, every data point that was graphed on the Cartesian plane while prime factorization was allowed to exist in a null factor showed that Kobe continued to fail theses primitive tests. I studied statistical variations in geometric localities and each and every one of their correspondent asymptotic differentiations provided me with the conclusion that your so called Kobe is the worst clutch shooter in the NBA.  Cosine functions developed at Princeton while combined with the Bell curve allows us to measure basketball production without affecting Higgs Boson-like particles that would otherwise exist in non-zero environments. And where do you think Kobe ranks on that scale? The bottom of the Bell Curve. They ran about ten thousand trials of the same repeating polymorphic routes emulating artificially generated synergy optimization and the Mamba was nowhere to be found in either planes. ""Eye tests"" are a layman's tool for avoiding thinking and this kind of narrow tunnel vision only exacerbates current falsifications that we can rely on such a poor method of extrapolation. I don't watch basketball but the fact of the matter is that I don't need to. It's all in the stats. The numbers don't lie.  Your ""Kobe"" is just an average NBA player who gets an ungodly amount of touches thanks to his marketing. Kobe was never the best player in the league, nor even a top 250 player in the league at any point in his career. I wish people understood more the numbers side of basketball and woke up and finally realized that this guy not only is overrated, but flat out isn't good at basketball in any way whatsoever"	1

"I dont think anyone who has the choice between a sink w/ soap and hand sanitizer is arguing hand sanitizer does it better. what IS being argued is when sink w/ soap isnt nearby, sanitizer IS a safe and convenient option to use when 60% alc or more. running down halls or to another building or wherever its obviously not convenient is not good advice when you have a reliable method in hand sanitizer.  shitposting up and down saying ""wash your hands!!!!!"" in response to saying hand sanitizer works on a post about hand sanitizer not working is stupid. if its convenient and right there, wash your hands. If its not convenient and you have hand sanitizer, use a healthy amount and youre fine. if anything opening door handles out of the bathroom that carry germs is far more dangerous to risk than hands free squirts from a bottle that can air dry where you sit. no navigating or grabbing of door handles required at your desk or whatever. neither option is bad, but going out of your way to find a sink w/soap because you refuse hand sanitizer is retarded."	0

"Assume by some natural process you detweilerTeej started turning into the opposite gender.  If you're a guy and you start growing breasts and losing muscle you will likely hate it, opposite is true for a girl who's starts growing larger and more hairy with a deeper voice.  You would likely feel like you are in the wrong body.   Its not so much physical ""damage"", its physiological. I'm not very invested in trans issues but at least as far as trans people *feel* that's the comparison.    Blockers basically buy time to make sure a kid really has gender dysphoria, and gets them closer to mental maturity so they can be more equipped to decide.  Downsides are not really known but at least from the available stats seem to strongly outweigh the psychological damage of making/letting someone go through puberty as the ""wrong"" gender."	1

I was going to respond with some stats to blow your mind, that Michigan in fact is far better in standard of living than the rest of the world, but I am realizing you are probably a troll and just wasting time.   I get you're insecure about your financial future but putting your hands over your ears and yelling ""bIlLiOnAiRrEs bAd"" isn't going to help. At the end of the day hyper capitalism has made improvements that vastly outweigh the negatives that come along with it. Nordic countries, and Canada greatly benefit from a lot of the innovation, and production that happened in the US, by profit seeking individuals. It is not the reserve currency for the rest of the world for no reason. For someone very learned on this topic you seem to not know much at all.   Canadian btw and while I love our healthcare system, I am not retarded enough to ignore the obvious benefits of capitalism and even aggressive capitalism. We directly benefit from their private medical sector where we can benefits from their developments in technology and medicine without any of the R&D costs. Unlike you I at least recognize the benefits of socialism, where your arguments are coming from some deep insecurity where you want to pretend profit seeking motive is fundamentally terrible."	0

"Bruh I'm with you, the love of the game doesn't mean being loud. Like it kind of wigs me out the European pride in their aggressive and ultra hive mentality fandom as if it's something that has this special exquisite thing that's part of a thing that you don't get if you're not a part of it. Like I've been abroad for years and like British people or whichever group of European people sometimes wave that around like it's significant. It's just eurocentrism, treating something different as if it has meaning because it's European. real basketball culture like Gary Payton or Kevin Garnett trash talking folks into tears and like looking to jump Scotty pippin playing around in Chicago as a kid is something which Americans are connected to even if for most it's very peripheral and when you hear stories about them or hear them talk, like, we get that shit in a way that a non-American just can't. I'd much rather have that than some lame and boring exquisitely ""significant"" and ""special"" loud hive atmosphere.   The phrase grit and grind is a good example, like we emotionally understand that phrase very immediately. Also even the way basketball has changed and shaped our language like ""balling out"" and shit like that."	0

Dirks one championship has more weight and meaning for his legacy that it catapults him into the same status as kobe or Lebron (also he’s pretty high on all time scorers list). He had been with the same team his whole career and just as he was reaching his twilight he upset the greatest team ever assembled (up to that point). I think Dirk will also be remembered for revolutionizing his position and the NBA as a whole. He was the first legit all star 3 point shooting 7 footer	0

Reply to any point in my other comment here, I’ll post it again, Below. Why weren’t they good enough to get 2nd seed with just MJ and role players, to avoid the pistons? Was it that mj needed what pippen later provided? Who knows. Also  Rookie Scottie in the playoffs averaged 26 minutes in there 3-2 win in the first round. I never said Scottie was better as a rookie, than cj is now. More so I’m talking about team fit not individual talent. The bulls needed someone who could raise their overall defense to elite, given mjs dominance in volume on offense and defense. Pippen provided that bump at the time. CJ alone doesn’t raise the teams at both ends in the same way. With MJ, they didn’t need a lot pieces to compete, but they still needed pieces.	1

Those picks could easily be more valuable than the thunders picks if they tried to contend for the next few years. Nobody has any idea what Houston or the clippers will look like in 3 years it would be supremely retarded to give 4-5 of those up for a very small chance at a championship. Just because nobody looks unbeatable doesn’t mean the thunder would become anywhere near championship favorites with Beal or Holiday. Not to mention you still have to match salaries meaning they’d have to give away a huge piece of the team no matter what.	0

I just have to go on a quick rant about how dumb and gullible NBA fans are. So I saw people bring this back up several times last night cuz of the game that was played on ESPN last night. If you truly believe Green called KD in the parking lot and begged for him to join, not only are you a fkn retard but you are very gullible. If you just think to yourself for 30 seconds, the story makes zero sense. How would the media find out about this cuz I highly doubt Green nor KD would tell a media member and I highly doubt a teammate would snitch on Green. That whole story was made up to create drama and a storyline and you gullible sheep believed it. Just like you believe everything the media says even tho 99% of it is fake news. The NBA media has the fans on strings since they are a bunch of clueless and very gullible puppets	0

"""He boomed me"" gets used over there fairly regularly as well as ""Driving around [City] begging (thru texts)""    In r/baseball here are some good ones:    Someone asked for a story where they met a player and he was an ass to them. A commenter told a story about meeting Troy Tulowitzki that seemed... dubious, wherein Tulo allegedly told two kids to go back to their bitch parents. The top response to that comment was: ""One time I was at YYZ just minding my own business doing a Sudoku when I hear ""hey fuck face!""

They even got back in touch a few years back after he figured out social media. They send each other family photos, swap work stories (they are all retired) and occasionally even skype on holidays. Last thanksgiving, I was over at my dad's and Josh was visiting while they were skyping. His mom knows from my dad that I'm a huge baseball fan and she offered to introduce us. Well, Josh would have none of it. First he pretended to not hear her while she awkwardly made excuses for him that he was busy preparing the turkey in the kitchen (we could see him right behind her coloring with crayons or some shit), but then he rolled his eyes and said ""for fuck's sake"" loud enough for us to hear. He finally came over into full view and I shit you not, was wearing a bib and holding massive turkey legs in each of his hands. He didn't say a goddamn word. No hello or hi or even a smile. He just looked into the camera with dead eyes and just sucked the meat right off the turkey bones, one at a time, like a little kid sucking jelly off his fingers. Fucking Beckett."""	0

This is a heart-stoppingly sad.  It really reminds you that anything can happen to anyone without warning.  I've watched the Lakers my whole life, and now it just feels like watching them going forward will always be tinged with sadness.  I just can't believe that Kobe is dead.  Like any fan, I shit-talked our star player, particularly during his ""farewell tour"" last season (typing 'farewell tour' just officially made me start crying).  The last thing I ever said about him on the Internet was very unkind, even if based in facts.  I regret being so cruel now.  I'm just losing it from emotions.  In a way, this is like living through Magic's announcement of HIV again, back when that was considered a death sentence.  I remember where I was (college class), who I was with, and the utter shock and sadness of everyone around me.  I swore to appreciate life more back then, and now I'm examining once again wether I've lived up to that oath of appreciating my life.  Just wow, and devastated.

Neither of you all know very much I’m willing to bet and with all due respect I’ve read no leagues across the globe in sports from soccer to American football to the nba speaking on no fans until a vaccine. Please stop the pessimistic views and let researchers find and develop treatments. And please before any predictions let’s see if we implement a system where we can test and monitor the virus and  hospitals can cope with the virus before they have to go into emergency crisis mode. This is much about having enough tests, tracing of COVID, research, and being able to handle patients while working on vaccines you understand.   Everyone with non factual based statements regarding sports and the coranavirus needs to stop predicting the fall and definitely 2021 while we are in the spring of 2020. The way this thing impacted society so quickly is the same way things may change for the better. Until then please chill with negative predictability shit you all have prolly done very little research on.	0

Yeah what a lot of it comes down to is this paternalistic bullshit from many males who pretend they know/care what’s best for women when they say “oh you can’t hire a women because players and men are so sexist it’ll be brutal for them they shouldn’t be considered hence!!”. I’m not referring specifically to who you are replying to but as a general point, Lol someone like Becky Hammond knows more about the nba locker room and culture than fans do.   If she thinks it’s too sexist an environment that the team wouldn’t be rrady for a head coach and hence she doesn’t want the position her coming to that decision is understandable. But that doesn’t appear to be what’s happening and yet many still insist “it’s unfair to her to even consider her a candidate and let her subject herself to misogyny!!”.

> You're dense lol. He literally lost cartilage and developed arthritis. Arthritis directly leads to loss of athleticism. It's 'minor' in the sense that the injury itself has a fast recovery time but it also causes permanent damage as he's had hip issues his entire career. He went through arthroscopic surgery. The very fact that you're arguing this is fucking stupid. Just watch him play. All his speed is gone. Before the surgery, his entire gait was fucked up when walking. When running he was limping around like a clumsy 7 footer, he couldn't cut, and he couldn't jump.  Holy shit, Basketball players are soft as fuck if that's a tough injury, it doesn't get more minor than that minor injury.  > He literally did run out of luck because it was a degenerative hip issue that was affecting him for his entire career until a freak injury finally took him out. You think scoring 53 points in the playoffs is luck? You think dropping 29 a game is luck?   Yes, it is when 1 year later you become 100% garbage for no reason, I'd understand if he broke his leg in half, but he didn't get any major injury or problem.  Guy ran out of luck.  > You're the only one that actually thinks it's a minor injury lmfao.  Because it is a minor injury.   > Why do you continue to pretend that you know shit about basketball? He's the third best point guard in history. was all-NBA 7 times, and was a perennial top 7 player in his prime. You probably don't think Charles Barkley is good either, because you're not a basketball fan.  Are you fucking serious? Those are two bums who never won shit. How can you set the bar so low for your athletes? What the fuck dude...  > He was a critical role player for the championship Mavericks, and continues to be a decent contributor.  What the fuck? Quick search.  18 minutes per game in the 2011 playoffs, he was a bench player, 9 points and 4 assists per game and no defense, he got most of those points and assists in garbage time. And you want to tell me that he was good?  Get the fuck out of here you delusional manlet. Haha.  The Mavericks would have still won the championship without him... As simple as that.	1

"Easy for you to say bro. Think of the trauma experienced by these guys. Put yourself in the shoes of someone like KD, or Spida: no cough, no fever, no congestion, no shortness of breath, no fatigue, no pneumonia, no symptoms. Seems like everything is ok, right? Well, check your privilege right there asshole, because not only did they have to hear from a doctor that they have it which is SUPER SCARY (yikes!), theres also a very good chance that they will also be affected by the guilt forever--knowing that they passed this on to other people who may *also* go on to not develop a cough, fever, congestion, shortness of breath, pneumonia, or any other symptoms. And then THOSE people could pass it on to others, who will again, develop no symptoms. Before you know it, everyone under 70 in this country will be walking around with this not even knowing they have it, while 85 year olds will be dropping dead in the hospital with respiratory diseases and heart problems to the tune of slightly below average flu season numbers. Yeah. Still seem minor to you now? Still think life's ever going to ""return to normal""?

So because you played this one guy in one on one that didn't post you up you don't think an NBA player would post up a smaller NBA player in a serious one on one game? Almost every time a smaller player is switched onto a bigger NBA player in a game there is a clear out and a post up. I don't even know how this is up for debate, it's just basic basketball knowledge. The easiest way to score on someone smaller than you is to post them up. If you played against someone that was 6'10 and he didn't post you up then I'm led to believe that either the game wasn't very serious or he knew he was just so much better than you that he didn't need utilize his size in the best way possible. In this game, Jeff Green couldn't afford to try to face up and break Steve Nash off the dribble	1

"Tf you mean ""Lmao did you really just ask that?"" You implied that Jordan leaving the Bulls equated to them going from 57 wins to 55 the year without him. It's flat out wrong. Critical thinking my fucking ass.   > transparently chasing rings  Are you just dense then? If you want to talk so much about Jordan's team changing after him leaving (which isn't what you fucking meant at all you fucking mong), let's look at the differences between Miami the year before that ""gOt BoUNceD oUt oF ThE FiRSt rOuNd"". Added: Mike Bibby, **CHRIS FUCKING BOSH**, Eddie House, Ilgauskas, and Mike Miller. The idea that Miami wasn't a stacked deck unlike joining the Celtics or Spurs is such horseshit.  > And when he left Miami, he chose the cavs  Jeez, I wonder if it had anything to do with the immense amount of draft capital they had and immediately turned into Kevin Love? I seem to remember in his Letter to Cleveland or whatever there was no mention of either Anthony Bennett or Andrew Wiggins and I wonder why? Maybe because they were getting shipped out on the next flight leaving Cleveland Hopkins airport.  >And then the same thing when he joined the lakers  And there was a huge amount of fanfare for him saying ""they were going to be patient, this was a learning process, they won't be instant contenders"", just for him to be passive-aggressive in the media and for Anthony Davis to sewer another franchise to try and force his way to LA. **And still** within 365 days of him being in LA, him and Klutch strong-armed a franchise into getting him a unanimous top 10 player/probable top 5 player in the league.  Cite David Griffin all you want, he holds no water for me. For all the talk about what a great GM he is, he hasn't drafted shit in New Orleans besides Zion (a gimme), and had his job saved by LeBron after he was at the helm when they drafted Anthony Bennett and Andrew Wiggins. For every story from David Griffin about LeBron not meddling, there's one from Pat motherfucking Riley about how **a month into his first season with the Heat** he asked Riley if he would fire Spoelstra and take over the team.  Who do you think has more cachet in the NBA? A GM who has done nothing noteworthy in his career besides cater to LeBron for the 3 years they were together, or **PAT. FUCKING. RILEY**?"	1

Everyone so far is saying it's the Warriors but the Spurs need some consideration too.

It was announced earlier that the trump administration didn’t even order additional respirators or masks until mid-late March. Yeah they did a great job there.   > I'm convinced half the Trump haters in the USA would be angry if he cured cancer for fucks sake. ""But... Why didn't he do it sooner?!? BLOOD ON HIS HANDS"".  I’m actually not a Trump hater. I don’t care for him but I would have voted him last election, and again this upcoming election if I was an American. At the same time he has done an outstandingly awful job at this time, and comparing his plan to other countries he actually caused the most harm to its citizens.   > I expect you won't be cashing your 1200$ check since you hate the President so much and he's done 'nothing' to help anyone.  And I won’t because I’m not an American and actually still have my job, I just work from home now. So I have complete job/financial security throughout this epidemic.

I'd take prime Kawhi over a prime Wade.     From 2004-2010, during Wade's prime solo years before the Big 3, the Miami Heat averaged 43 wins a season.      Granted Wade missed about 30 and 20 games two of those seasons, but the Heat really should have a better average record than 43-39.  &#x200B;  Kawhi somehow has that X-factor that translates to championship contender, in his unassuming manner.

Jordan had tougher competition over the course of the entirety of the postseason altogether. Lebron only had 1 round to worry about. Lebron had his super stack super teams, MJ did it by the book from the ground up and kept his coach around. MJ had overall tougher competition and lebron had overall tougher finals opponents. That's what happens when you inspire others to follow the voltron superteam culture that he started. Beating up on Kemba walker is not a valid or notable postseason achievement.	0

Scottie didn’t have to be that elite to get them over the hump. They needed other defensive options to cover for their lack of a true defensive center imo. Either way I don’t think they win as many games or as good of a team without pippen. They might not have made the 2nd round at all without pippen his rookie year in my opinion.

Warriors didnt struggle to score when they played their motion offense. The reason for their struggle was Kd playing iso which made their offense predictable. The cavs might have won.

So if someone like Rachel Nichols didn't give Curry the 1stvplace vote then obviously YOUR opinion on it would totally change right? This is hilarious and even more so you refuse to answer a big question that is directly related to the validity of the most impressive MVP title. SMH	0

Don’t worry, they’ll literally be fine unless they have preexisting serious medical conditions and are sick anyway. In which case their tragic demises will be due to their other comorbidities but [falsely blamed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/99-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-says) on “coronavirus” to make the headlines scarier for the public.   The “test” for SARS CoV-2 is [admittedly and evidently meaningless](https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/international-news/disease/dr-wolfgang-wodarg-confirms-this-is-an-insane-panic/) and not causally connected to a disease. Your chances of “dying from coronavirus” are, in reality, negligibly small, as in not worth worrying about.

I think there are positives to testing asyntomatics and weakly-symtomathics group of  the population and not just individual that are symptomatics. I think it is possible that the lethality of this virus is greatly exagerrated by the bias in the testing process and perhaps a more efficient solutions could had been reach if we had understood the virus better. Say for instance, that the virus is only weakly symptomathic or is asyntomathic in a redicolous number such as 99.9999% of under 40s with no pre-condition. If We could somehow just implement social disnancing measures for over 40s and under 40s with pre-conditions and let the virus go through the rest of the population in 3 or 4 weeks without impacting significantly the health system. This would not only reduce economic damage, but it would allow for greater support of our critical industries and a reduction of the risk of exhusting our critical resources, which is the compunding factor of a pandemic.  Of course, such an approach would require much greater precision, and it would require pre-planned and preantive measures. Stratigacally accelerate the curve for subgroup and desaccelerate it for another group, a feat of social-engenering perhaps beyond of what is possible for country like US.  But, a fact is that the economic and social damage of this measures taken by the government are also real, and perhaps for some very large subset of the population the remedy is more harmful than the disease.	0

"They could have offered him the larger extension this previous offseason. The article is referring to the offseason before that, when Kyrie and the Celtics were in good terms. Since the season happened, the Celtics made absolutely no attempt to re sign hkm despite having the chance to offer him a bigger extension than any other team before free agency began.  You're completely changing your ""facts"" about the Celtics waiting for Kyrie then only going after Kemba when Kyrie left..  Kemba signed with Boston when Kyrie was still a free agent..  Your facts aren't actual facts."	0

It was my senior year of high school basketball. It was a David Vs Goliath game. We were playing a highly ranked team in the equivalent of our playoffs. We were significantly smaller and had been blown out by them earlier in the season.   Anyways, there was 1.4 on clock and we were down 1. We called a time out and we decided to run the exact same inbound play we had been running the whole game. They had been leaving the short baseline open all game, and we figured they would likely pack the paint. It worked to perfection. We hit the buzzer beater and our entire team ran onto the court. It was a good a day.	0

I'm 20 so I'm just not going to incorporate Wilt or Russell because I cannot properly rank them in any way, they are just all time greats and I will leave it at that.   1. Michael Jordan  2. Lebron  3. Kareem  4. Hakeem  5. Shaquille O'neal  6. Larry Bird  7. Tim Duncan  8. Kobe  9. Magic  10. Kevin Durant   Kevin Durant in the top 10 I know really bold but I guess a lot of my ranking is based on my lack of knowledge of other all time greats who could easily be higher but I guess I rank how skilled a player or how good they are pretty heavily that is why I have Hakeem very high on my list, higher than a lot of people would have him.	0

When all is said and done,  Steph would probably rank as the 2nd greatest PG of all time behind Magic.

People underrate how difficult it is to make a pass in the half-court in the NBA. You see players doing it with seemingly ease but they're all the best athletes in the world.  I feel like I'd get 5 rebounds over 82 games no problem. There are times the ball's just going to bounce your way. The 20 points would be difficult but possible mostly thanks to free throws and occasional wide open shots because the other team doesn't take you seriously. But the assists man. Every opposing player will smell blood in the water.	0

I would like to see Duncan carry that horrible Minnesota team for 12 years. Garnett was the reason why fans were coming to T-Wolves' games. He meant a lot to city of Minnesota and he knew that, thats why he didnt leave them for all those years. Never forget that legendary MVP season in 2004. where Garnett carried T-Wolves to the Conference Finals. Bill Russell said that if Garnett doesn't win a ring, he will give him one of his. Luckily Garnett got his well deserved ring in 2008. He even came back to play his last season in Minnesota. We will never see another player like Garnett. The Greatest PF in NBA history. A role model for millions NBA fans. Thank you Kevin for everything, and congratulations on becoming a HOFer.	0

Neither of you all know very much I’m willing to bet and with all due respect I’ve read no leagues across the globe in sports from soccer to American football to the nba speaking on no fans until a vaccine. Please stop the pessimistic views and let researchers find and develop treatments. And please before any predictions let’s see if treatments improve enough where hospitals can cope with the virus before going into emergency mode. This is much about treatments and research seen? While working on vaccines you understand.   Everyone needs to stop predicting the fall and definitely 2021 while we are in the spring of 2020. The way this thing impacted society so quickly is the same way things may change for the better. Until then please shut the fuck up with negative predictability shit you all have prolly done very little research on.	0

Oh Kanye, that moment helped me learn to question how my world was being portrayed to me as a teenager living a cushy life in the suburbs and begin to realize the systemic racism and inequality rampant throughout America.

So basically create a good team filled with veteran role players and stock up on assets to pull the trigger when a superstar becomes available.  Sounds like a good strategy, but I think there are so many ways to screw it up.  Just looking at the Pistons, they really don’t have any assets outside of Luke Kennard and wasted their one opportunity to stockpile some more by not trading Drummond earlier.  Also keep in mind it’s extremely difficult to win a championship in the NBA.  I’d say you need at least one top 5 and one top ten player and competent vets, or three players in the 10-15 range or better just to be in contention.  So even if the Pistons were getting a healthy peak performance Griffin, it still wouldn’t be enough.  Also the sixers were stacked with top end talent and still lost in round two (embiid, Butler, Simmons Harris are all in the 8-15 range).	0

The Penny Shaq team was probably the most electric team I've watched in my life outside of the Splash Brothers Warriors.. I just remember there was just so much expectations for them. If Nick Anderson hit those free throws (watched it live), they may have been champions. Shaq leaves, Penny is injury plagued, and the rest is history. Pretty sure even Jordan thought Penny was the next Great.	0

Again I said our government would do it, I never said theirs would. Thanks for failing to actually read anything. I never said I’d rather have an economy over human lives, I said blaming trump is retarded bc it literally isn’t his fault. You’re wrong. Our leadership has been great these last 4 years. That’s why our country was booming on basically every front. Trump is going to bend Biden over a barrel in November (you know, like Biden does to non-consenting women) and you’re tragically going to have to suffer through 4 more years of absolute success in America. Boohoo for you. And saying I’m barely human bc of your incorrect assumptions, you better be anti abortion bc that’s taken 60 million human lives mainly in the name of personal finance	0

**How do I work?** First I read as many new comments as I can and turn each one into a list of noun phrases (things like 'raindrop' or 'brown paper package'). Next I pluralize them and run them through an algorithm to determine the number of syllables each noun phrase contains. If I find that your comment contains three noun phrases of 2 syllables each, one noun phrase of 5 syllables, and one noun phrase of 6 syllables I simply insert them into the lyrics and post them back to you! Finding noun phrases, determining syllables counts, and pluralizing words are all very tricky and I often make mistakes!

Culturally, 2007 was a long time ago. And even young adults (18-27 or so) can hold some pretty immature, dumb thoughts that get straightened out by life experience.   In the 1990s, when LeBron grew up, homophobia was part of the built in culture. Go back and lock at the gay jokes in Friends and Seinfeld and other movies and sitcoms.   None of those jokes would fly now. In Frienda, Ross’s wimpiness is built on the fact that he wasn’t man enough to prevent his wife from turning lesbian.	0

"Assuming you're referring to elected officials and not voters, I completely agree with the first and last sentences, but not the middle one. Right now, the best people among us are either the essential workers who are politely sacrificing their own well-being and accepting the inevitable sickness/chance of death, or the people who are staying as isolated as possible and taking repeated punches in the mouth like champions. The worst among us are the ones not willing to personally sacrifice things such as social life, money, personal health, or electability.

Picking durant at shooting is dumb. You have to take Curry, he is by far the best shooter ever.  Durant shot 45 from the field and 32% from three in the post season before he joined a 73 win team that made back to back finals and won a title without him.  Their last 3 postseasons without being on the same team  Durant (16,14,13) - 49% EFG% and 57% TS   Curry - (16,15,14) - 56% EFG and 60% TS   Last 3 regular seasons without each other curry still out shot him   Durant - (16,14,13) - 57% EFG% and 64% TS  Curry (16,14,14) 60% EFG% and 64% TS	0
Lmao yet lebron gets penalized for the 2007 finals when he was a pup or against a stacked GSW team...anyways MJ was always on the better teams in the finals while lebron was only on the better team twice if you wanna look at vegas odds...but ye make excuses for MJs loses and hold lebron over his career lmao	0
"Lillard waving goodbye  a lot of people are just listing ""great shots"", which to me is a totally different thing than a ""go fuck yourself"" shot.  It needs to be a shot that is probably the wrong play statistically, but you're irrationally confident about because you disrespect your opponent. Lillard embodied that more than almost anyone I've ever seen with his waiting out the shot clock and heaving up a contested long range shot and immediately trolling the opposing team."	1
