Imagine putting Kobe in your top 10 let alone top 5. This guy is easily the most overrated player of all time and the morons put him there solely cuz he won 5 rings which is irrelevant cuz sports are scripted. If you base it solely off achievements, he is no where near top 10. Try doing research instead of listening to the paid shills AKA media. Media says Kobe is clutch yet if you look up his clutch stats, he shot 27% in the clutch which is terrible. Media D rode this guy for whatever reason. Must be cuz he played for LA	0

If that is true then it is absolutely not racist to blame China for the virus. They have such an insatiable obsession with eating exotic animals and poaching. It is truly there fault.

When I was 13, I knew this girl who was my age. Looking back now, I realize this girl was a little hoe. Hell, this girl asked me(we were both 13), if I ever got a BJ. She told me she liked me, a few days later, she tells another boy she likes him. Fast foward a few months, this girl gets pregnant by a 20 year old. Looking back now, I dont blame the 20 year old because I know he didnt rape her. She was a crazy little slut. I blame the little hoe and the little hoes mother.  Everyone always gets so outraged but truth is, you dont know the facts. You don't know if this girl lied about her age and said she was 16 or 17. You can't say Karl raped her because you werent there, and he was never even charged with rape.   He was 20 years old at the time. its a 7 year difference...   The other day on /r/relationship_advice I saw some early 20s girl post something about marrying and having a kid with a like a 40 year old. It was like a 19 year difference and no one bats an eye.	0

"Lillard waving goodbye  a lot of people are just listing ""great shots"", which to me is a totally different thing than a ""go fuck yourself"" shot.  It needs to be a shot that is probably the wrong play statistically, but you're irrationally confident about because you disrespect your opponent. Lillard embodied that more than almost anyone I've ever seen with his waiting out the shot clock and heaving up a contested long range shot and immediately trolling the opposing team."	1

So if someone like Rachel Nichols didn't give Curry the 1stvplace vote then obviously YOUR opinion on it would totally change right?

I never really understood this line of thinking. The poster you‚Äôre responding too clearly believes that by his inaction, Trump is responsible for the deaths and illness of many people.

First of all, I was just pointing out that the guy I responded to is simply spreading misinformation that quarantine will result in this pandemic passing over faster. I never said itd be better to have more deaths so that we can get over this faster.  Second of all, no, we shouldnt try to keep the number of cases as low as possible as that would extend this pandemic too long to the point that the economy is absolutely tanked and the resulting fallout is even worse. The real goal is to find the perfect point where the total deaths of the impact of corona and a decline in the economy is at its lowest.	0

If you read enough history you see this pattern over and over and over again. Concentrated wealth leads to revolution or collapse if it's not met with regulation first.

"You saying it's racist doesn't make it racist. It's not racist. Under your premise, any joke or accurate assessment of a geographical configuration is racist.

It's like Bill Maher says ""You lose any credibility when you start calling everything under the sun racist.""  And you cut off the definition on purpose ""prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.""

I don‚Äôt know if finding blogs about preseason/playoff predictions really tells us the 2010 Celtics and 2009 Magic were better than the 92 Blazers, 93 Suns, 96 Sonics, 97-98 Jazz. Especially when bloggers weren‚Äôt really around during the 90s.   I only know how great those teams were because broadcasters talked about them during the 96-98 Jordan run, my time on basketball forums on insidehoos, realgm, etc (2009-2013).   Anyway, here are some ‚Äúblogs‚Äù about teams that never won a championship. The Dwight Magic aren‚Äôt on any of the lists, neither were the 2010 Celtics. Though the C‚Äôs won in 08, one of the articles won‚Äôt list them as it was more about multi-year squads.   https://www.sportscasting.com/great-nba-teams-didnt-win-championship/  https://www.chatsports.com/nba/a/Throwback-Thursday-The-10-Best-NBA-Teams-Never-to-Win-a-Championship-17635#/  https://www.realclearhistory.com/articles/2018/05/31/10_best_nba_teams_that_didnt_win_a_title_317.html  https://www.basketballnetwork.net/the-6-best-nba-teams-that-didnt-win-a-championship/  https://www.complex.com/sports/2013/06/the-best-nba-teams-to-never-win-an-nba-title/	0

> This seems forced though.   It's a big difference in the overall level of anxiety/privacy/fear one is FORCED to carry. Imagine that you can't let it slip that you have a girlfriend or who you are going on vacation with or who you go home to. You can NEVER go on a date and never talk about anything about relationships like everyone does normally all the time. You don't get to participate in life like a normal person.   So to avoid this constant daily harm, everyone is being FORCED to understand that being gay is fine. So I guess you're right in a way.	1

This is why this sub will never be a viable place for analysis of basketball. People want to scream and bitch in their comments everytime the team they hates benefits. The fact no one wants to mention Theiss constantly hooking AD under the basket or the tick tacky fouls that brought the Celtics into the game says everything. Both teams had a missed goaltend. The JB call was bullshit. Just because only the bad calls are being posted for one team doesn't tell the story of the full 48 minutes. Anyone that understands basketball and watched 48 minutes would undoubtedly know that this game was in no way decided by referees.	1

To add more context, the November 17 date is from back tracing in the search for Patient Zero; it was not known at the time that the patient had a novel coronavirus. The first cluster of patients that were identified to have an unknown virus causing pneumonia occurred in mid-late December.

He is averaging 29/5/9 on 45/37/85 shooting splits (60% TS) for the whole season. In wins he is averaging 35/5/9 on 53/48/80 shooting split (69.6%!! TS).      He absolutely deserved the starting spot and if you don't think so then I really question how much you've really watched him play.       > They‚Äôre bad on offense and defense. The system is designed for him to get points.      This has got to be one of the stupidest statements I have ever seen. He is an elite scorer and an elite playmaker and you're trying to phrase it to say that the Hawks team is only made for him to get counting stats. They aren't a great team so there is only so much he can do but what he is doing has been historic for an individual. I don't know how you can even watch Hawks games and act like he doesn't deserve the starting nod. If he didn't play I doubt the Hawks would even have 5 wins for the year at this stage.	1

Assist to turnover only tells you who makes riskier passes if they have similar passing abilities. Riskier passing isn't always bad if it gets better looks for his teammates get .

He touched his head. I don't care how tall Tacko is, if you set up a goal and can't clear it, it's not a perfect score dunk.   In general there is a huge score inflation and a ton of dunks got in the 47-50 range which is stupid, because then the truly great dunks are under scored. If the dunks were put on a more realistic scale, I don't think it's a 50 point dunk.  edit: I think this is the first time I've seen a 100+ point comment marked as controversial.

"> ‚Äúthey [Europeans] just learn how to play basketball while our guys [Americans] learn how to dunk and put together mixtapes.‚Äù  This is only racist if you want to think of it that way, but ignoring race altogether this statement is not wrong **if you generalize** which Cuban did  AAU basketball has definitely turned us into a culture of running and dunking. This is not racist. Mac McClung was a phenom on the highlight circuit because of his dunking ability and he's white. I can show you lists of other playlists of these 5 star prospects running and dunking. That's not seen in europe like it is here, and no this isn't racist this is just factua. The big name high school players are the ones running and dunking in AAU ball   ON the contrary overseas players are frequently seen as being 'skilled' more often than american players. Sure there are exceptons but look at most european big men"": they are great passers, they shoot free throws well, and they have overall basketball savviness. The Gasols, Jokic, Sabonis, Vucevic, it goes on and on. This is not seen as much as it is in American centers. How many american born centers do you see with this craftiness? Obviously they have these skills to *some* degree but in European players they tend to show better basketball 'skills' than do the likes of Drummond, Dedmon, Whiteside, Okafor, Howard, McGee   you are trying too hard to make it a race issue"	1

"The link you shared was one guy giving his own opinion. The guy I replied to said it was ""unanimous"". That means everyone thinks it with no dissent. You posting one person's opinion doesn't show universal agreement. Maybe you're not sure what the word ""unanimous"" means? Giannis has been the front runner, but it's still a two person race, and it wouldn't be if everyone agreed there was only one clear choice. I can't explain it to you any more clearly than that.

He can follow the pj tucker move and learn to be a defensive minded player most who can shoot the ball well. But man I was shocked when I read nick nurses comment in regards to stanley at the start of the season this year. Nurse was targeting all of the new players including stanley   (https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2858387-raptors-nick-nurse-offers-critique-of-rondae-hollis-jefferson-stanley-johnson)  During this season ronde seemed to accept his role and learn the defensive schemes of the raptors, which resulted him to play more minutes. But stanley is a better defensive player than a offensive player, and he was criticized that badly by nurse. And never showed any improvement towards nurse that warranted stanley to play more. That shows you that during this season Nick nurse just gave up on Stanley in terms of playing him.	0

No thats nowhere near a realistic portrayal of the situation. This virus kills the old and already sick, for the absolute majority it will be similar to a flu. Mass unemployment and a deep depression is much more dangerous. And your second point is just ridiculous. Tens of millions are living in poverty, and they are barely covered by benefits. Imagine if 50 million more people become unemployed and now will rely on the government for food and housing. Thats the real societal collapse, not a flu that kills the old and frail mostly. Sure the virus will cause many people to need to stay home just like during a regular flu, but after 1-2 weeks those people will have recovered and hopefully have immunity.  You and everyone else here are doing exactly what that guy warned against, which is to buy into the panic and act in stupid emotional ways. The only solution is the vaccine, and no country can stay locked down for more than 3 months.	1

Obama and Trump have not caused the deaths of anywhere near as many people as Bush did. Libya, the drone program, and the typical coups that Obama backed were all awful and Trump is loose cannon, who seems ready at any minute to start a genocide of brown people. However, from a foreign policy stand point alone Bush and his entire administration deserve to be hanged at the Hague. The comparison isn't even close. He started a war that killed nearly a million people that he justified with evidence he knew was fraudulent explicitly to gain access to Iraq's oil reserves. Reserves that he wound up handing over to the Chinese when it was all said and done. Every person to die as result of warfare in Iraq since 2003 has died because Bush was willing to lie to Congress, the UN, the courts, and America at large to get his rich buddies even richer.  Trump is pure evil, I'd say one of the most despicable men to ever hold the office. But his incredible capacity for evil lacks the resume that Bush's did. Bush is by far the most destructive and morally bankrupt man to hold the presidency in my lifetime, and probably yours too.	1

"That's a good question. I used to always defend him, but stopped because his legacy is less debatable now. But you should have seen r/nba before he won a ring. Basically like 80% of people here were Skip Bayless clones, and defending LeBron was pretty unpopular and met with downvotes, even though some of his best seasons were before he won a title. So ""Bronsexuals"" were just a reaction to mass stupidity."	0

"> So the federal minimum wage .... how dense can you be? Your own link is tell you that you are wrong.  Oh god he's retarded...  In USA: Federal minimum wage means enforced minimum wage for everything except small exceptions (AKA the vast, vast majority of things)  In Canada: Federal minimum wage means everything that the provinces don't have control of (aka minority of services)  So Sanders minimum wage proposal > *significantly* more to the left of current Canadian minimum wage system.  >You: ""Sanders would be to the left or center of Canadian politics""  I never said he would be in the center. Are YOU having the stroke? Or do you just need to make things up so you can win the internet argument? Sanders would be far left in Canada.

"It's not devaluing if you value different things. It's why everyone has a different person for the GOAT Convo.  If I was able to change history, I'd say James Harden didn't deserve his and Giannis's MVP coming up would also go to LeBron.  Others disagree because it's TRUE, Harden had 15 more wins, but his stats were worse and he clearly had better help, along with a very strong narrative of being ""ROBBED"" twice. Everyone was on his dick in 2018.  And Giannis ALSO deserves MVP, his season is comparable to 2013 LeBron and 2016 Curry, but I'd still choose LeBron because I feel like he's still better and has a bigger impact.  My opinions are just that, opinions. Learn to make your own judgements."	0

"i'm certain the most important thing every season for utah fans is making sure rudy gobert makes the all-star team. i don't understand it because nearly every single time ""the best defender in the nba"" plays the rockets he gets run off the floor. it's quite embarrassing to be honest. you can't go from getting embarrassed by capela to getting embarrassed by covington.   but i truly do feel bad for utah fans. they know for a fact that no matter who they add to their team they'll never be able to beat james harden or the rockets when it matters. adding westbrook to this team must sting even more seeing how utah feels about him.  it must be such a helpless feeling hating two players as much as utah does and knowing that in spite of their burning hatred towards harden and russ they'll never be able to beat the rockets.  sure, people will bring up the rockets vs the warriors and that's fair. i admit. but that doesn't change that everything i just said is true.   here's to hoping mitchell/gobert isn't just another stockton/malone jazz fans!"	1

Charles Barkley had too fat of an ass, and well some players couldn‚Äôt contain him or themselves  To put it in a nutshell	1
I have played against a few actually. In high school, I played at a prep school in New England, a lot of the best players from the East Coast end up at one of these schools. I played against Donovan Mitchell and Devonte Graham - they were actually on the same team. Their team was basically twelve deep with D1 talent so those two actually did not have to do much, and we still got completely smoked (our team was acutally really good itself). Warm up lines were very entertaining to watch. They had such high, effortless, speed. And their fakes and dribble moves were just so convincing. I was a rotation player, and spent some time guarding both of them, and basically felt like my shoes were nailed to the floor. They weren't though, I just suck.  Some lesser known players I played against during the same time period are Noah Vonleh, Wayne Selden, Terance Mann, Bruce Brown, and plenty more high major guys who are probably drifting around the G-League and European leagues. I could go on and on about these guys. I think Wayne Selden caught a 360 alley oop in game, and also hit eight 3s. Noah Vonley was basically a 6'10 point guard, who also just made every shot.  If you did not know, ESPN ranks the top 100 high school basketball recruits. At the time I actually had a player ranked in the top 30 on my team. So I played against him basically everyday for two years. He was a super bouncy PF. I think he plays in Europe now after having a slightly disappointing college career at a high major program. In pick up games within our team, it was fairly common for him to 360 windmill on a breakaway. He definitely had serious aspirations of making the NBA - at the time me and my teammates thought he could go one and done. In college he was mostly a rebounder and all around athlete, but in high he could basically do whatever he wanted, even against the best competition in the country. In practice I honestly think he dunked on me 30 - 40 times; a few of which definitely could have made ESPN if someone was filming; I think i am in the clear though	0

That's not at all what it states, it backs the original commenters point that if Warren was as progessive as she claimed to have been she would have backed a candidate who shared her policies/ not gone back on some of her progessive stances. You refuted that implying she can still be progessive without endorsing Bernie, I explained to you how all of their shared progessive platform wasn't enough for her to endorse him while the other candidates policy is completely opposed to hers, making her not as progessive as she claimed to be, the orginial commenters point that you seemed to disagree with. You can blame Bernie for not running a good campaign but Liz's failure to quit the race before super Tues with no path to the nomination while the centrists all dropped out and endorsed Biden the days prior was a massive and decisive swing in the primary. Was always going to be an uphill battle for Bernie and fine with him not winning, but disappointed in Liz not backing the candidate that ideologically was extremely similar to her	0

While the rape allegations are definitely a bad light, I at least speak for myself when I say that I truly think Kobe was a champion for women. He was one of the few NBA players that actually went to and supported women's basketball games. He respected game regardless of gender. He just wanted to see people hoop.   He was passionate about his daughter's basketball ability and wasn't saddened to not have sons. He became an incredible ambassador for women's basketball.	1

They're also in the process of [claiming the US Army maliciously released the virus in Wuhan](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-china-conspiracy-theory.html) which is why you're seeing Trump attribute the virus directly to China.

Tough because they are probably the 2 best Centers in the NBA. Both players can't seem to stay in shape and look winded towards the end of the game. Embiid is hands down a better defender and scorer. Jokic is a better playmaker and is more durable when it comes to injuries. It's tough but if I had to pick, I say Embiid because when fully healthy, he's Hakeem 2.0. His raw skills to dominate the position on both the offensive and defensive is unstoppable.	0
"If you were saying the latter then why do you keep sticking by the former? I dont even care for you to change your stance but you should recognize your tone and that words have meaning. If you want to say they are within their grounds to take it down then you're right. If you want to say iyo they should have already taken it down, awesome.

"Weak East??  The Cavs sweep the Washington Wizards. Despite Arenas being hurt, that year Caron Butler was all star, and prime Antawn Jamison (20/8 machine being a good shooter even playing the 4)  Won in 6 against prime Vince Carter, prime Jason Kidd and prime Richard Jefferson. Let that sink for a few seconds.   Defeated in 6 the Detroit Pistons... Chris Webber, Antonio Mcdyess, Tayshaun Prince, Rasheed Wallace and Chauncey Billups with one of the best playoffs performances ever, scoring. 29 of the last 30 points of his team against the 2nd best defense in the league.   Weak East...  LeBron averaged 25/8/8 with 2 steals with one of the slowest pace teams in the playoffs.  His second best teammate was Larry Hughes... 11 points per game on 34% shooting. And Ilgauskas, 12/9  And evidently, they lose against prime Duncan, prime Manu and prime Parker (MVP of the finals). That Spurs team had the best coach ever or one of the best in Pops, Defensive especialist Bowen and good and experienced players like Michael Finley Robert Horry.  To put you all in perspective, Michael Finley had the same numbers with better % than Larry Hughes (in theory LeBron's best teammate)   Because I am an old fan and I don't forget.  The Cavs signed Larry Hughes after his best year and Donyell Marshall and people were talking about a ""big 3"". Well... LeBron's supposedly co-star impacted the game same as the Spurs 4th best player..  All of this while playing 45 minutes per game those playoffs"	1

I was criticizing a moron who wants to think about when and where basketball needs to be played down the road can the eye of a pandemic that's killing our countrymen putting nurses and doctors at extreme risk with honestly no end in sight at this point. Over three million people have applied for unemployment.  People are out of work losing their jobs & don't know when  or how they're going to be able to support their families again. It's not a priority. And that's what Baron Davis was calling him out for. You want to watch basketball go on YouTube and watch all the classic games subscribe to ESPN Plus if you need your fix so bad. Either now or whenever the f*** it's appropriate to start playing basketball or thinking about that. Now is not the time to be talking about the future of basketball when our present situation is this critical and swiftly approaching FUBAR. FUCK YOU.	0
">Sorry but no? More exposure does not mean more cases, just more deaths because hospitals cant handle all those cases.

That playoff run was everything. Not only did Dirk play out of his mind all playoffs, but he got revenge against the same team that broke his heart 5 years earlier in the finals and he did it by spearheading one of the greatest comebacks ever in game 2. The general consensus among nba fans was that Dirk would retire without a ring, that he was soft. It was incredible seeing him finally come through and putting all that to bed. The sad thing is he should have been in the mix more afterwards. If Cuban doesn‚Äôt split up that team the following season I think they‚Äôre repeating or at least competing. One of the biggest misconceptions about the 2011 Mavs was that it was some sort of fluke. That‚Äôs false, that team was really really good especially defensively and Tyson Chandler was the heart and soul of that defence and the perfect big to play next to Dirk. I don‚Äôt understand the decision to let him go.	0

Isaac Okoro, though a lot of ppl have started to catch on. First and foremost he‚Äôs a winner (tough, competitive, fills multiple roles), great defender, underrated passer, plays to his strengths and rarely makes mistakes. Even if he doesn‚Äôt end up being a star he‚Äôs gonna be a plus role player even if he‚Äôs just putting up mediocre numbers. He‚Äôd be the bench player that plays 25mpg and ends up closing games for you  Jalen Smith, lean and mobile 6‚Äô10  3 and D big that can also rebound. Really fits today‚Äôs game. Honestly don‚Äôt know why he‚Äôs so low, might be because this is his second year? Don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs wrong with him besides maybe lacking star upside.  Amar Sylla, basically an ahead of schedule Pascal Siakam. Plays for Real Madrid too so you know he‚Äôs learning the game the right way. Has to clean up his skill level and put on good weight, but I think his versatility is really gonna help get him on the floor	0

But it drives me nuts that Wade simply says he will call his daughter she/her and she has a feminine name now is enough for people to leap to all those conclusions.  What he did should be the default reaction. Calling someone by a different name/pronoun is easy and reversible if this is something his daughter goes back on later in life.

Curry won his Mvps, scoring title and a championship without kd. His numbers dropped when kd came. You can argue that kd killed curry's dominance and didnt help him. Kd was the beneficiary of curry's dominance. Kd never had a signature playoff series till he went to the warriors. Okc called him Mr unreliable because his numbers dropped in the playoffs. In golden state he became an afterthought because teams were worried about allowing curry to get hot.. Klay haas shot 41.9% 3pt for his career. Without curry, that 3pt % drops to 38%. We all saw draymomd's true value this season. Draymond is only a beneficiary of curry. Put draymond on a team with westbrook and im sure he wont even be in the starting line up in 2 yrs.. Curry is a great shooter from 3pt, midrange, finishing around the rim and the best FT shooter in nba history..Curry finishes around the rim more efficiently than kyrie. Kyrie may be flashy but curry is more efficient..He makes his team mates better. Half of the players he took to the finals last year arent even in the nba anymore..  Hope you understand that curry became an all star and all nba player under mark jackson. Before steve kerr became their coach. Draymond wasnt even a starter then. And also he was supposed to be an all star the year before but was snubbed..Even charles barkley cursed the all star voters out in 2013 for snubbing curry.	0

I'm 20 so I'm just not going to incorporate Wilt or Russell because I cannot properly rank them in any way, they are just all time greats and I will leave it at that.   1. Michael Jordan  2. Lebron  3. Kareem  4. Hakeem  5. Shaquille O'neal  6. Larry Bird  7. Tim Duncan  8. Kobe  9. Magic  10. Kevin Durant   Kevin Durant in the top 10 I know really bold but I guess a lot of my ranking is based on my lack of knowledge of other all time greats who could easily be higher but I guess I rank how skilled a player or how good they are pretty heavily that is why I have Hakeem very high on my list, higher than a lot of people would have him.	0

My dad is a weirdo for holding me accountable for literally stealing from him.   If you think a 2 week punishment is proportional to using 16k on video games then you are just retarded.   16k is how much you make working minimum wage for a whole year. A reality that many Americans face. Maybe have some perspective  Now you will imply that 16k is nothing to Kendrick but it will just prove how disconnected someone like that is from the real world and thus how that punishment was literally nothing	0

"Jaylen Brown is the reason I work out. I have this fantasy where we start talking at the Vanity Fair Oscars party bar. We exchange a few pleasantries. He asks what I do. I say I love him on Boston.

they were a perennial western conference finals team and he had an mvp caliber teammate. yes most superstars would kill for that, durant was blessed to have the teams he did in oklahoma.   You can't look at russells TS%, he's never been known for efficiency. He had series where he shot poorly, but people were saying russ was playing better or playing his heart out, like in 2014 or 2016.   But KD is known for efficiency, and 54% TS% is bad for him.	1

>In 2018-19, this possession would have been credited to Harkless since he defended Russell for five seconds in the frontcourt compared to two seconds for Harrell. However, it is Harrell that contests Russell‚Äôs shot attempt, while Harkless is inside the key defending Paschall at the time of the shot.  >Heading into the 2019-20 season, the matchup data has received an overhaul to resolve situations like this and provide the most accurate information available. **Now matchup data is being captured at every moment in the game, so if a switch occurs, two players will be assigned matchup time against that offensive player and the data will show who is actually defending the shots.**  does this resolve the issue you are referring to?	0

Well considering that his offense fell off a cliff come playoff time, I don't really think those all defensive selections meant much when he could never get out of the first round with the Wolves - barring one year. It's like saying you'd rather have a worse scoring Kawhi Leonard than James Harden. 25ppg on 58TS is so much more valuable in the playoffs than an awful 18ppg on 52TS. Offense is always more impactful than defense. Always.	1

Okay I think him getting hate during a rape accusation is a little different. During the latter stages of his career the hate was not there in that way.   I‚Äôm also not speaking on overall criticism. I‚Äôm saying specifically that the people who hate LeBron do so with a deep passion for minuscule reasons, and they make it their life‚Äôs mission to ridicule him. I don‚Äôt see that with Kobe, but I wasn‚Äôt old enough to remember the early 2000s.	0

You shouldn't believe anything. Don't believe propaganda or illogical media telling you what to believe. There are enough whistleblowers out there saying covid is being marked on patients that died who clearly did not have it that you should at least use common sense to doubt what you are being told.  What were we told at first? MILLIONS COULD DIE. 65m Americans might die.  They have to falsify literally every person in ICU that they can, and the numbers are still pathetically low lol.  I'd be all over the hate Gobert bandwagon, if this was actually the plague or something. Right now this all seems ridiculously fishy, and no one will probably have a clue what the truth is.  Maybe they are doing it to reset the economy, to gather data about the environment, et cetera. And maybe they are just grabbing more power. Nobody knows. What we do know is that covid is not even close to what the fearmongers were saying, and there are multiple studies out there that say staying at home, with so many exceptions like we are now, doesn't even help.	0

This is actually not true. I assume when you say ethnic, you're not referring to black people, and you are Hispanic/Asian.    > Roughly six in ten white (59%), Hispanic (60%), and mixed-race Americans (59%) and close to seven in ten (69%) Asian-Pacific Islander (API) Americans favor same-sex marriage. Black Americans are more divided with fewer than half (48%) expressing support for allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry, while 41% are opposed. However, this represents a five-point increase in support for same-sex marriage, compared to 43% in 2015.  This is from https://www.prri.org/research/americans-views-discrimination-immigrants-blacks-lgbt-sex-marriage-immigration-reform/.  Theoretically speaking gay marriage support isn't a perfect correlation to homophobia, but it's a decent measure. In this case, Asians and Hispanics support gay marriage more than white people, and black people support it decently less than white people, 59% vs 48%, but that's not like some insane margin that would lead me to say that it's much more unpopular among people of color.	1

">Do you realize that Eric Holder is the only attorney general that has been held in contempt of congress?  If you are saying 'the democratic Congress has no balls and no teeth' then I agree with you. Sadly the Democratic Party isn't a cult like the Republican Party who are more than happy to lie, obfuscate and cover for their cult leader every step of the way.  >And has Bill Barr ever said he was the president wingman?  No, instead he published a bullshit summary of the Meuller Report until enough people lost interest, when he should have released the whole damn thing. Then he redacted the most incriminating parts for Trump in an effort to cover for the Lord Emperor in the name of National Security. Something that has raised the ire of a Federal Judge. If the next AG wanted he could prosecute those actions as obstruction of justice and obstruction of Congress. And that's just the tip of the iceberg with this criminal.

It‚Äôs not fake. But it‚Äôs demonstrably a microscopic deal compared to the flu.  China has less than a quarter as many active cases as they had 3-4 weeks ago. They‚Äôre going to end up around 6000 casualties.  Compared to 400,000 to 800,000 flu deaths they‚Äôll have this year.  How are people freaking out about this ???  I live 5km from the Italian border.  Right now, there are about 1/500th as many infected Italians with coronavirus as there are with the flu. 1/500th.  Even if you go by the alarmist estimates of COVID being 10 times as deadly and 3 times as infectious, I‚Äôm still 17 times more likely to catch the flu and die from it if I go to Italy right now as I would be to catch corona and die from that.  I‚Äôll bet ANYONE willing right here, any amount of money they want, that the total confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US won‚Äôt reach 300,000.

">""You look amazing"", said Mitchell, hands on his skinny jeans that barely skim his butt cheeks. Only Donovan could pull off something that sexy and still look classy. ""Come on, let's dance"", said Gobert, pulling Mitchell over to a minuscule space directly in front of his line of vision. ""You're a great dancer"", said Gobert in gruff tones, ""Champagne?"", Donovan pretends to hesitate ""Of course"" he says. Gobert takes Mitchell's hand and walks up to his room, where an ice bucket and a bottle of Laurent Perrier await. He pours out some glasses, toasting ""To the most beautiful shooting guard in the room"". The truth is, Donovan is more than happy to keep flirting; he is incredibly attracted to Gobert, with his intense brown eyes and his ripped body. Mitchell lets out a sigh that's completely genuine, as Gobert pushes him into the bed, he notices four wide, black silk ribbons are tied to the bed frame. Gobert leans down and kisses Mitchell, his lightly stubbled cheek brushing against Donovan's nipples. He takes the right nipple in his hand and rubs it under his thumb as he bites down gently, teasingly."	1

Literally every other thing in Kobe‚Äôs life does not point towards that situation being the way the girl said it was.  No other women have ever had anything to say about him + the story just is really bizarre.  Hate to be that guy but nearly positive she did it for the money not because she was actually afraid for her life at any point nor was she raped.  I hope she feels like shit right now tbh but she‚Äôs probably still out spending the money she essentially stole legally from him.  Girls going to hotel rooms and making out etc not expecting things to turn into sex are just outright delusional.  Be more responsible.  Furthermore she ‚Äústayed late at work to meet Kobe‚Äù she really that big of an NBA fan?  Also talk about unprofessional using your job to meet and solicit a celebrity.	1

Re liability, come on, are you going to sit there pretending that a ton of massive companies with billionaire owners haven't already begged for bailouts and asked their workers to stay home unpaid.  Also, you are clearly misrepresenting the other side of the argument.

Reposting from another thread to spread awareness:  Damn.  Not to take away from Jaemal‚Äôs embarrassment because I know firsthand how it feels but this really throws back to the time my fucking sister posted our video on her finsta.  I didn‚Äôt even wanna go to school the next day cuz everyone already knew (we were 2 grades apart, she was a junior and i was a freshmen)  Prayers go out to Jaemal for this. Shit is embarrassing af and it‚Äôs honestly the worst feeling. I‚Äôm probably gonna reach out to him to let him know he‚Äôs not alone  All in all, let‚Äôs respect this man‚Äôs mistake and move on from this. It‚Äôs extremely embarrassing for your videos to go on public by accident and I really wouldn‚Äôt wish it on anyone‚Äî celebrity or not and hung or not. Jarmal Murray is a great basketball player and I hope he can be remembered as that rather than someone who‚Äôs sex tapes were leaked. It‚Äôs actually incredibly embarrassing for the girl as she is facing embarrassment because of the fuckup of another person, in my scenario i can relate to his girl because my sister somehow posted our video because she‚Äôs a dumb bitch.	1

"/u/XTheLegendProX is a spam/scam account. If their comment contains a link (in which case, the comment was probably edited to get around spam filters) do not follow it.

They have likely deleted evidence of their spamming so you can't see it in their profile. Typically they have multiple alt accounts manipulating the vote and ""thanking"" each other or asking where to get it.

"We were all mad at the guy that killed Jordan's father. I'd have to google it, to see if that's the real reason he went to baseball. But that's what I've hung onto.   That first half season he came back there was a lot of anxiety to see the ""real"" Jordan. The championships won during that in between time were fake. They weren't earned from Jordan. They were like kids acting up when the substitute came in.  When he finally traded the 45 in. That was for real. However crafted that was, I dunno. But I bought that Hook line and sinker.  With the COVID deal, thinking about watching the finals again. But think I'll start with the Pistons beating the Bulls that year prior. That series, losing to Thomas but knowing it was just fuel to the fire, is the first time I remember watching Jordan. As it is now, I can't even remember all six opponents. (Lakers...Jazz...Jesus time to watch some 90s ball.)"	0

"Think about your comment on the Lin thing. Why was Melo so unhappy and vocal about Lin's contract ""being ridiculous"" (in Melo's own words). When has another player so overtly ""counted another mans bread"" and commented on it so negatively?   I am sure that Melo's team made many bad moves that wasn't a ""win a championship"" move (not a difficult assumption has his teams never came close to winning). Has he ever raised such a stink about how another player's contract would be ridiculous and stop his team from winning championships?   The answer is that althought Melo may not have been a terrible teammate overall, he was terrible to Lin. Maybe its because Melo didnt like someone taking his shine, but I would be shocked if race wasn't the main factor."	0

">That still doesn't make it their responsibility to close our borders and make more virus tests.  The blame for the slow response goes to the White House and only the White House.  I have never given my opinion on the White House's actions but I do not agree with how the president handled the situation.  Like I said, I only wanted to point out that saying journalists need to be spoonfed information is asinine. It's not like they don't know about the seriousness of the situation, they have Chinese correspondents for crying out loud. On top of that their job description is to literally do research and not just trust everything someone tells them.  The assumption that a white house briefing turns ""travel bans are racist"" into journalists delivering a heartfelt message to the american people like you're suggesting in the post I responded to is, in my humble opinion, psychotic."	0

Or put him as the center on defense his reach is so big that noone could actually attempt a throw bc nobody can throw this high and be accurate.	0

"> You do realize that teams have an opportunity to offer an extension before a player hits Free Agency right?  That's how the NBA works.  I get that you're new to this.  The Celtics DIDN'T offer an extension.  Not that they couldn't, they simply didn't.  They moved on from Kyrie and his toxic personality. You claimed that they ""waited"" for Kyrie and moved on to Kemba. Now you're admitting that you made that up?  [According to Lowe, the Boston Celtics would have offered star point guard Kyrie Irving an extension last fall ‚Äúbut rules capped Irving‚Äôs first-year salary in such a deal at 120% of his 2018-19 salary ‚Äî well short of what he stood to make by entering unrestricted free agency.‚Äù As a result, the Celtics knew that it would be all but impossible to convince Irving to sign the extension, a scenario that‚Äôs a common happenstance in the NBA.](https://celticswire.usatoday.com/2019/07/24/report-celtics-would-have-offered-kyrie-irving-an-extension-last-fall/)   Let me guess, Zach Lowe is lying too?  > You've provided 0 facts.  You clearly don't know what a fact even means.  Kyrie Irving being on a completely different tier than DLo, as well as an actual professional basketball team choosing Kyrie over DLo as recently as this summer isn‚Äôt an opinion. It‚Äôs a fact."	0

I would like to see Duncan carry that horrible Minnesota team for 12 years. Garnett was the reason why fans were coming to T-Wolves' games. Never foget that legendary MVP season in 2004. where Garnett carried T-Wolves to the Conference Finals, and if they got past the Pistons, they would meet Lakers in the Finals, and i believe, become NBA champs. He was so great that even Bill Russell said if Garnett didnt win a ring, he would give him one of his. Luckily Garnett won the ring he deserved in 2008. He even came back to Minnesota to play his last season there. We will never see a player like Garnett ever again. Congrats Kevin, you deserve to be in the HOF	0

Thought it was just me. This is fascinating.	0
Dude, if you think players normally equal their stats from regular season to finals you know jack shit about basketball. The more you talk, the more apparent this becomes. He averaged 1 more turnover than he normally did. I can't believe this is your basis and you genuinely believe this is worthy of discussion.   You wonder why Curry gets a pass for 2016 and LeBron doesn't for 2011? It's because they aren't even close to comparable. And me continuing to indulge this argument is beyond a waste of time.

"Bruh I'm with you, the love of the game doesn't mean being loud. Like it kind of wigs me out the European pride in their aggressive and ultra hive mentality fandom as if it's something that has this special exquisite thing that's part of a thing that you don't get if you're not a part of it. Like I've been abroad for years and like British people or whichever group of European people sometimes wave that around like it's significant. It's just eurocentrism, treating something different as if it has meaning because it's European. real basketball culture like Gary Payton or Kevin Garnett trash talking folks into tears and like looking to jump Scotty pippin playing around in Chicago as a kid is something which Americans are connected to even if for most it's very peripheral and when you hear stories about them or hear them talk, like, we get that shit in a way that a non-American just can't. I'd much rather have that than some lame and boring exquisitely ""significant"" and ""special"" loud hive atmosphere.   The phrase grit and grind is a good example, like we emotionally understand that phrase very immediately. Also even the way basketball has changed and shaped our language like ""balling out"" and shit like that."	0

"He is smart. But he gets caught up in pseudoscience from time to time, and has a tendency to state things as fact that simply are not. And occasionally, such as in Talking With Strangers, says rather... atrocious things. Specifically, when he talks about the relationship between alcohol and rape. It is a very, very uncomfortable read. In the book ""Blink"" he basically espouses mind reading in various parts.   He's a very bright guy, but he loves to play to the new age-y nonsense crowd. He has some legitimate ideas, and he does a good job popularizing a number of social science ideas, it's just interlaced with bullshit. Which makes it kind of super frustrating.  So yeah, you didn't get the wrong impression of him. He's just got a lot of problems, and shouldn't really be taken at face value. He LOVES to speak about things as known or concrete even when the evidence is flimsy at best.   But again, he also popularizes a lot of things, and gets people interested in social science stuff to begin with, which has its benefits. So yeah. He's no the devil or anything, he's just not really a real source for knowledge. If you read anything he writes, use it as a place to start digging deeper, double check any claim he makes, etc.  Also, he IS a great writer. Dude can weave a really awesome narrative. And has great style and stuff."	0

Had ankle issues that could have ended his career but miraculously became healthy and became 2 mvps. Won his franchise their first championship in 40yrs.

"So it's more complicated than that, but I don't think the Nets should be blamed.  Basically the United States CDC decided to develop their own test. They did this because they didn't want to rely on the WHO test. Their initial problems generally stemmed from the fact China was refusing to ship virus specimen samples, so we had to get them from someplace else in the early days.  Then they fucked up the first test they created which basically meant they had to design a second one. They also had to throw out about 150,000 testing kits which had them on pace with what the WHO had developed at the time.  The problem is further compounded by the fact that the laboratory testing equipment the CDC and public laboratories have is sometimes different than that in most major research hospitals, which is generally different than that in most regional hospitals, and what is available in private labs is often a mixture. That is why you have different insurance networks in contact with different labs developing their own testing capabilities, so they can insure that their network has access to testing.   These things take time - it's not really a lack of resources. There is all the money they need and basically every lab that does this sort of thing, both public and private, are working on it.  So it's not just a matter of ""put money into increasing production,"" or ""buying them from abroad."" It's not like there is a plethora of equipment used for RNA extraction of samples just lying around, or a massive untapped manufacturing capability for that sort of specialized equipment.  But the reason I disagree with people casting this as ""rich versus poor"" is that diagnostic criteria for testing people is often going to involve behavior and the number of people that a subject would come into close contact with. Someone like an NBA player is at greater risk than your average Joe because they get swarmed by fans in public, not to mention they are effectively part of a population where n = 450 and public health officials know some of them are infected, so testing that whole population makes sense from a medical perspective."	0

I am saying of the **top rebounders in the NBA** and you're comparing Giannis' rebounding statistics to Lebron, Harden, and Westbrook?  &#x200B;  Top 5 Rebounders:  &#x200B;  Drummond @ 15. 8 REB  Gobert @ 14.6 REB  Whiteside @ 14 REB  Capela @ 13.8 REB  Giannis @ 13.4 REB  [https://stats.nba.com/players/rebounding/?sort=REB&dir=1](https://stats.nba.com/players/rebounding/?sort=REB&dir=1)  &#x200B;  Top 5 Contested Rebounders:  &#x200B;  Drummond @ 7.3 C.

Compare that to Drummond who is #1 in all 3 categories, Capela who is #4 total rebounds, #3 contested, and #2 offensive, etc.	1

[Mod Post] New Mod Application Thread  It's that time of the year again and we're looking for new mods!  In particular, we are looking for mods to assist our team with further automating subreddit processes. We are also looking for mods to help remove/approve posts and answer modmail.   Please answer these questions in your comment.  * What timezone do you currently live in? Central   * What are your normal reddit operating hours? I am available most of the time as a student I look through reddit throughout the day.   * Roughly how much time do you spend on /r/nba on a daily basis? Probably my top 3 subs I use so a lot of the time I‚Äôm scrolling through r/nba   * How long have you been a part of our community and why do you think you'd be a good addition to the mod team? I‚Äôve been on r/nba a few years now and enjoy it a lot. I think it‚Äôs one of the most progressive subs especially for sports.   * If there's one thing you could change about /r/nba, what would that be? Probably more clear rules on why things are getting taken down.   * What is your favorite NBA memory? When Steven Adams missed a free throw on purpose to give it to Russ for the 3.  * Do you have any experience with CSS? Not really but I pick up on things fast.   * Do you have any experience with PRAW or python? Feel free to link anything you have created using them. I use python for classes. I‚Äôm in engineering so it‚Äôs mostly for math needs.  * Do you have any experience hosting python script? No but I can learn  * Are you interested in helping mod the sub discord? Yes   Basketball is my favorite sport and without it I‚Äôd have a lot less entertainment in my life   The rest is up to you guys. Feel free to add anything else that you think might help make a case for why you should be a moderator for /r/nba.  All unrelated comments will be removed for sake of readability. Keep in mind that the amount of upvotes you get in this thread will not have an impact on your application. Please direct all questions to the sticky comment.	1

Because he's fucking right most of the time?  When we're 5 minutes into the 4th review of the last two minutes of a close game, he should be allowed to point out how stupid it is what we're watching.  You shouldn't get multiple free timeouts (that last forever) in the fourth quarter of a game.  The NBA should take notice and fix that shit, instead of trying to pretend like it isn't happening.  like real shit, 99.9% the time we see the replay on the broadcast and we can make the call almost immediately.  Why doesn't the NBA have a ref watching the broadcast so they can make real-time decisions right then and there?	1

The best Avenue for NBA Expansion is to expand here in America and to other major U.S. cities with strong Pro Sports history such as Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Tampa Bay for the NBA Eastern Conference and to San Diego, Seattle, and my hometown of St.Louis for the NBA Western Conference as well with six brand new NBA Expansion teams to balance out both conferences and add bring new major American cities into the NBA fold and bring more action and excitement into the league overall in my view.  #TheNBA!!!!! #NationalBasketBallAssociation!!!!! #NBAExpansion!!!!! #TheTimeIsNow!!!!! #AmericanExpansion!!!!! #TheNBAMustExpandHereInTheUSA!!!!! #NBABaltimore!!!!! #NBAPittsburgh!!!!! #NBATampaBay!!!!! #NBASanDiego!!!!! #NBASeattle!!!!! #NBAStLouis!!!!! #GameTime!!!!! #NBA2021!!!!! #BringItOn!!!!!	0

I was never talking about unbeatable. Michael Jordan needed Scottie to get out of the 2nd round. That is what I said. I never said Scottie was his best when they first made it out of the 2nd round. I also said nurk would give Lillard a chance to make it out of the 2nd round, implying they could compete potentially in the wcf with him. That was all I said. Then you brought up cj in comparison to Scottie when they don‚Äôt provide the same sort of core value to the offense and defense that nurk/Scottie do/did in comparison. I think you are slightly undervaluing young Scottie because they ended up losing, when I am only talking about competing, not completely dominating.	1

Not to mention he got draymond suspended on some bitch shit	1
And how do you know that everyone who has ever been appointed to a cabinet position has been what you consider qualified? Have you interviewed every single person that has been appointed? How do you know the people that Trump has appointed are not qualified? Have you interviewed everyone of them? Or researched them? That's kind of the point of the elected official, you give them discretion to make certain decisions.  And as far as Kushner, have relations with Saudi Arabia gotten worse? I don't think so. I'd say he's done a good job so far.  And as a business person, Kushner does better when the American people are. So I don't know what clashing-interests you are talking about.	0
He definitely needs to improve his shooting, but I'd give the benefit of the doubt to the guy running the best offense of all time, before telling him what he should and shouldn't be doing.	1

"This dude (not you, the bootlicker) is what happens when you skip common sense and dive straight into finance and politics with zero mental capacity to grasp either one's actual purpose and application.

We are literally *experiencing* a once-in-a-lifetime situation RIGHT NOW, ON A GLOBAL SCALE, that demonstrates as obviously as possible that the economy absolutely crumbles without the masses spending and this dumbass is still arguing that billionaires maintaining their hoard in tact is more important for the economy than the spending power of the population at large.

Almost everything you said was wrong. Scottie played the 2nd most minutes in that knicks series to put them in the ECF his 2nd year. By the end of his second season he  was starting pretty much every game? He was averaging 15 points on good shooting while being an elite best in the league defender. That is how they got to the eastern conference finals. The year before when Scottie was a rookie they didn‚Äôt make it out of the 2nd round. Scottie was 4 year college player. By his 3rd year in the league he was an all star	1

Do you think the offense really wants to dribble backward away from the hoop when they only ha e 24 seconds?

The fact that he is averaging more over the past six games than Harden has ever averaged over even just three games without needing to draw fouls to do it is a testament to Dame's greatness as a player, it makes every point matter more, it makes you hold your breath the whole game and I bet anything it drags the Blazers to the playoffs.

All I learned from the NBA is that it's fine to act like an uneducated retard and you will slide under the charges because of your privilege, even if you are risking killing people  Dumb people need to be shamed publicly and since he has a decent salary, he should be hit hard financially to get a message sent. Somebody like him won't register wrongdoing unless he gets thrown in jail for a few months, cut from the team. And then his money fucked with.  Fuck this guy he also infected his teammate donovan mitchell who is way more valuable, and all around more intelligent than Rudy gobert.  First bending over for China over protest criticism...

"I'm working on a project right now in Hollywood with a pretty urgent deadline, and the whole group I'm with is just utterly stunned, to the point that all work has just stopped, and nothing we cared about deeply just hours ago even matters.  This is a heart-stoppingly sad.  It really reminds you that anything can happen to anyone without warning.  I've watched the Lakers my whole life, and now it just feels like watching them going forward will always be tinged with sadness.  I just can't believe that Kobe is dead.  Like any fan, I shit-talked our star player, particularly during his ""farewell tour"" last season (typing 'farewell tour' just officially made me start crying).  The last thing I ever said about him on the Internet was very unkind, even if based in facts.  I regret being so cruel now.  I'm just losing it from emotions.  In a way, this is like living through Magic's announcement of HIV again, back when that was considered a death sentence.  I remember where I was (college class), who I was with, and the utter shock and sadness of everyone around me.  I swore to appreciate life more back then, and now I'm examining once again wether I've lived up to that oath of appreciating my life.  Just wow, and devastated.  Appreciate life, folks, appreciate life.  Rest in Peace, Kobe."	1

he was being fouled on drives and they weren't calling it, plain and simple. if it happens today he starts shooting and bitching but in 2011 he had played the role of villain (which he isn't comfortable being) and just kind of shut down and tried to facilitate.   wade took 15% more shots and got 150% more FTA, bosh took 1% more shots and shot 140% more FTA  lebron's FTA were 2/4/4/4/2/4  his FGA were 16/15/14/11/19/15  he took half his shots inside 10' and actually got most of his FTA on shots OUTSIDE 10' which is fucking weird and has probably never happened to him since  #chalmers got 3 more FTA on half as many shots and he only took 9 shots inside 10'  but someone had to pay the price for the mavs getting fucked in 2006 and who better than the league's newly crowned supervillain  on the other end, lebron got called for 20 fouls, the most on the heat and the 2nd most overall (chandler 24)  it was just a weird series and the only thing he could have done was make bombs. up until that point of his career, he was 31/190 for 16% on deep 3s  after that point he's 85/258 for 33% on deep 3s and that's above the league average (the last 4 years he's become ELITE at long 3s, going 69/179 for 39% which is at the top of the NBA)  he evolved to prevent that scenario from happening again. elite players evolve or they don't stay elite for long.	0

Bro I'm over 40 and don't use IG or Facebook. That's the issue, so many different people who watch games feel the same way and since you're a Stan your comeback is to bring up IG and Facebook.  I didn't see one person let alone analysts that was saying Atlanta or Toronto had a real chance at winning a title or the East. Actually people were bored with the league because everyone already knew who were going to be in the finals. It seems like you are one of these Stan's that tries to push false narratives and then when people don't agree with your fandom you accuse them of not watching games lmfao	0

Bro you Celtics fans are delusional AF. The Rockets fan is right, and I'm not even a Harden or Rockets fan.  I checked the stats, Harden puts up almost twice as many points, more than twice as many assists, and is assisted on 14.1% of his 3's whereas Tatum is assisted on 61.1% of his 3's.  Harden is a far more efficient volume scorer, putting up far more points on higher percentages from everywhere (Ft, paint, mid 2, long 2), the only place Harden is below Tatum in efficiency is assisted field goals.  Harden also does all this while putting up 35.2 ppg over Tatums 22.2ppg on a higher EFP.  Harden Shooting Stats by distance   .534  .650  .398  .480  .500  .356 (Harden is assisted on .141 of his 3's)  Tatum Shooting Stats by distance   .473  .602  .373  .410  .375  .387 (Tatum is assisted on .611 of his 3's)  Oh and Assist to TOV% 1.64 for Harden and 1.35 for Tatum.  There is practically no comparison between the two players whatsoever.  Harden is a far more efficient scorer and assister with heavy ball usage volume scorer putting up 35.2ppg and 7.3apg.  Tatum is a below average creator, below average shooter, but is an above average catch and shoot 3pt shooter putting up 22.2ppg and 2.9apg.  Oh, and as for consistency, Harden appears to be far more consistent without doing the advanced math, he literally goes 3 months without dropping below 23 points in a game while his FG% sits in the 15.4% and 66.7%. His worst game being 12 points on 13 fg's.  Tatum's consistency is notably worse, his FG% jumps between 5.6% and 80.0%, while his worst game was 5 points on 18 fg's.	1

I would not say it is a win for both teams. I am calling this a clear loss for the Hawks, even though they got a very good consolation prize.

No, that wasn't their point. Their point was that we shouldn't be upset at the team. We should be, though, because they used tests others needed more.

This is the most important comment in this chain. Trans issues, especially where minors are concerned, are still treated with a healthy dose of gay panic and fear-mongering by people who actively want to harm these individuals, and oftentimes talking points get picked up in the swirl of condemnation by well meaning people who aren‚Äôt as informed on the issue.  Dwayne wade simply said that he supports and acknowledges his daughters existence. He never went into detail about what that meant, but plenary of people outside of the issue like to fill in the blanks for themselves with the most extreme version of what ‚Äúsupport‚Äù means.  Also, just as an addendum, hormone blockers can actually be extremely beneficial to adolescent trans people, and many of the supposed ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù ramifications are in serious dispute because of the wide range of experiences on them.	1

A single percentage that encapsulates the entire area inside the 3pt line isn't telling you how someone scores directly at the rim or in the post.   >Lmao did you ever watch the Heatles? 80% of their offense was iso Wade or LeBron. I remember seeing stats where them and Bosh put up like 90% of the Heats points every year.   Exactly. LeBron AND Wade. He was sharing those duties with another ball dominant player. Not to mention his usage never even touched Harden's over the past 3 years.   >What's not to get? A good portion of Wade's career was just driving to the rack and flopping to go to the line.  It's obvious you don't know what you're talking about lmao. He was able to score out of the PnR, in post ups, from mid range either off a step back or a pull up, he had floaters, and he was a great off ball cutter. Not having a 3pt shot doesn't make someone one dimensional.   >Do you have any actual stats to support Wade is better offensively than Harden?  Obviously not because you're skewed to Harden's last 3 years where the Rockets were running one of the most iso heavy offenses ever.   >Or are you just going to write off all mine with your biased fanboyism?  It's not fanboyism to point out your lack of knowledge.	1

I think you‚Äôre underestimating how bad things really were at the time for them to do that and with the new era of social media, sports, Netflix and drugs being easy for people to get if they want people are always able to distract from wider issues that don‚Äôt directly affect them. Back then they were literally starving to death it would take something like that for a revolution to happen it would have to be a significant amount of the population literally on the brink of dying before this would happen.   There‚Äôs also the fact that despite its glorification the French Revolution didn‚Äôt really help things that much while they had some great ideas they also decided to execute anyone who disagreed with them or if they were just religious and it lead to lots of people just trying to gain more power for themselves. It wasn‚Äôt French Revolution happened and then the monarchy never came back and everything was good there were like 4 French Revolutions and lots of government changes and deaths.	0

dude was literally in the middle of a FEDERAL CASE because he was gambling illegally at that time and he lied to the NBA about it. they found out when the feds came knocking and MJ had to go to court and testify against his old bookie (taking tons of illegal bets) to save his own ass. his bookie was on trial and he had a lot of MJ's checks that were 6 figure checks. MJ initially said the checks were forged but when under oath he admitted that he had given him teh checks for gambling debts.  THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER LAWYER FOUND DEAD ON A GOLF COURSE WITH ANOTHER 6 FIGURE CHECK FROM MJ IN HIS POCKET. never heard of anything coming from that  another guy wrote a book with proof that he had won $900,000 from MJ via golf.  his dad was just killed and to this day there is no evidence linking either person in jail to the crime.   a book written about the whole thing figures the mob killed his dad because him and MJ were doing shady shit that was fucking them out of money. MJ with his gambling and they thought pops was a drug mule.  his dad was convicted of embezzlement right when MJ was drafted into the NBA, as well  MJ's family is kind of nothing but crooks and gangster-wannabes and that's why he acted the way he did. he wasn't mentally tough and ultra prepared, he was ultra-talented and nothing but a dickhead shyster	0

">You have not debunked a single thing in that video. The only thing you proved is that the word soon is technically true if you want to be generous and include that we will have it by next flu season.   I'll keep copying and pasting until you address it.   LMAO okay man. The video is nothing but bullshit. The virus wasn't a big deal in America mid January at that point. No need for revisionist history. Saying that most people will get better is TRUE. Saying that it will likely be over soon is TRUE. Saying there are treatments and vaccines coming soon is TRUE. Like the majority of what he said in there is factually correct. Why can't you understand that? He has taken the measures necessary to get this under control. It's also his job to not fucking spread panic and throw us into anarchy.  Literally a week before Trump said he didn't think it was a pandemic in January the WHO was saying that human to human transmission of the disease was not happening. The entire fucking world wasn't taking it seriously at that point.  >Comparing to regular drugs development is a strawman. His intent was not ""dont worry we will have a vaccine within 12 years""  His intent is that we will have something to fight the virus in the near future. Having a vaccine ready by next flu season is fucking soon man i dont give a fuck what you say. Keep ignoring the fact that therapeutic treatments are available already. Doesn't fit your retarded narrative.  >That was a total of what 5-7 seconds of the video. How about the other 2:05? The video is date stamped, it is not trying to skew what he said, even said there are only 8 cases in America at the time. That does not dismiss the criticism of him saying ""we have shut it down"" while cases were on the rise in January, not does it address the other 95% of the video.  I addressed most of it in my previous comments. Please read slower.  >Your link about test kits having the hiccup (which I cant even read because you linked a website that forces you to create an account) does not dismiss the criticism of him saying ""as of yesterday and today anyone can get a test"" These test production errors occurred in February, it was known at the time we did not have enough tests and he lied about it.  How does it fucking not? Companies preparing and shipping tests tell trump they are ready and how many will be available now and in the future. Trump then says they're available. Then you have the issues come up. Is it that hard to follow dude?  >Now we are on to whataboutisms. I am not a fan of any of the people you have named. I have never voted democrat in my life and am just as critical to them as I am Trump. Wish you were too, but your likely part of the Trump cult who are political hacks who consistently trash the media for being fake news but never Trump who is one of the largest providers of it.  DGAF who you voted for. You would be surprised who I voted for in the past but that's completely irrelevant. Doesn't make your retarded logic any better. It's not whataboutism, it's admitting that the dude isn't perfect but that video is bullshit and is overplaying any apparent mishandling of the virus.   >Please show me where you debunked that Trump did not say cases are going to go down in late February when there were 80K+ cases in the world?  Talking about the vaccines. What he said there was flat out wrong and I already said as such.  >If you reread what I wrote, I specifically said Trump did not say this just that he consistently endorses the people who made those dangerous claims. I said people at Fox went even further than Trump did. I did not say Trump said it was a hoax nor that he praised their specific response to the hoax. The favorite network of the guy who consistently says ""fake news"" were endangering people with their careless reporting on the virus.  Such an absurd way to attempt to attach something to Trump it's not worthy of a response."	0

He really was the face of our city in a way not even Jeter or Magic or any sports legend from here can compare to. But that doesnt mean other people didn't share that love. PG is just saying that for us Kobe Bryant was part of our daily lives, from conversation to conversation, even after he retired. The lot of us were crying over his retirement lamenting that basketball would never be the same. But again, Kobe was an influence for many people and deeply loved all over, so I can understand why people would be thinking he's gatekeeping grief. I get where he's coming from though.	1

My dude you are a clown. You posted blatantly wrong information that the tallest player is the ‚Äúde facto center‚Äù as if there‚Äôs no difference between middle school basketball and pro hoops.

It‚Äôs also awesome how one of the sources you credit, outside of the wiki page that only has information any 6th grade who‚Äôs seen a basketball game would know, is basically ‚Äútrust me I know what I‚Äôm talking about‚Äù, like you Just discovered a new element because you know that centers are tall.  I disregarded the rest of your ‚Äúargument‚Äù because it‚Äôs nonsense, you can‚Äôt be older than 14, nobody needed you to write 3 paragraphs to try to prove that centers are tall lmao all anyone was saying is that center is a position usually played by the tallest player, but to say the tallest player is the ‚Äúde facto center‚Äù is just outright wrong especially in the nba.

It sounds like you want it to be worse in May so you can be right in this. You don‚Äôt need to overreact to the virus, it‚Äôs bad but it‚Äôs not world breaking. All people have to do is be a little careful and stay home as much as possible for a few months, if people do the right thing the virus will be beaten. Almost every person that gets this virus will be fine, the hard part about it is how easily it can spread, other than that it‚Äôs not a scary virus.	0
Corona Virus is a group of diseases (well viruses to be exact) that only poses threat to people that have weakened immune systems, have another major disease meaning babies, very sick people, and old people with deteriorated overall health.  No NBA player (assuming all of them without any major diseases) is in danger of ever getting fully sick from the Corona virus. They might get affected and be a carrier, but none of them are at risk of dying (since that's what most people are concerned about).  And to the people thinking guys like Embiid are at a higher risk - Physically injured a lot =/= prone to diseases. Guys who eat ass or get dirty with the strippers are at more risk than the guys who get muscle tears or knee problems.	1

Dwight was amazing OFF the ball or on the pick and roll. But he had no really offensive moves with the ball in hand.   His foot work was mediocre at best, and his only move was this shoulder drop-then-spear that should been called for an offensive foul more often than it was.   We actually saw that in the NBA finals when Gasol was taking the bump/charge on that move and the officials actually started calling it after Phil Jackson made a point of mentioning in a post-game interview (taking the fine for criticizing the officials).   The issue was that Dwight simply wasn't the kind of guy who had the offensive tools to average 25+ a game, but he wanted to be in the conversation with Shaq, Hakeem, and Wilt, not Mourning and Mutumbo. So he wanted more touches, and more time in the post, and SVG woulldn't give it to him (and for good reason).   Which soured his relationship with Orlando.   Then Dwight didn't want to run the pick-and-roll in LA and got stuck with an offensive coach who didn't care about D.   But even on defense, there were times when Dwight would do that volleyball spike. I felt like it was just because it looked good. He could have tipped those down and kept position instead of giving the ball back to the other team out of bounds.   He was great to watch, but those highlights are misleading. They show his athleticism at its best.	0
Read on if you feel called (warning: wall of text). If not then just ignore as you might think I‚Äôm throwing propaganda around.  I don‚Äôt mean to be insensitive, I only wish to speak the hard truth. Today is a serious reminder that life comes to an end. We are immoral. We can accumulate the world and yet we still leave this earth with nothing. Even Mamba.  I just want to encourage anyone who is dumbstruck, hurt, or confused, to know that there is a God who loves you, and that life truly is fleeting. We are here (quite literally) for a blip of time. There‚Äôs way more to life than this short amount of time. Accepting Jesus into your heart changes everything. You begin to have a purpose that‚Äôs way bigger than anything here on earth; only because you can take that purpose with you beyond this life. I would love to talk more about my transformation - I‚Äôm no perfect Christian, I‚Äôm a big sinner, but life has so much more joy and meaning - even in despair like this. Please feel free to reach out if you want to talk more. Even if it‚Äôs an educated debate. I‚Äôm cool with it.	1

First, I remember healthcare prior to Obama. You're right that healthcare has been free market in America for a long time. But never before has it been so closely tied to employment where almost all large employers are forced to provide healthcare for full time employees. It fucked up a lot of people's lives and is part of why so many people have to have two jobs now.  At a place I managed we used to have full time hourly employees just out of high school. But with Obamacare we cut all their hours to less than 28 per week to avoid having to provide healthcare for them.   Any full time employees and their employers immediately starting paying premiums for ALL employees. This immediately added billions of dollars in premiums to the corporations controlling health insurance.  It also forced many companies to cut hours so much that people who were making a living before were completely screwed.  And a healthy person used to be able to choose rather they wanted to pay out of pocket for a yearly checkup or pay for insurance. It's cheaper to just pay out of pocket for one yearly visit if you are lucky enough to stay healthy.   Health insurance is supposed to be used for risk mitigation. If you're low risk then why should you be forced to pay exorbitant premiums???   Plus, those premiums are not on a case by case basis. If they were healthy young 20 year old would pay very little in insurance costs. As it is young employees on a company provided healthcare plan pay the same as a 40 year old or 50 year old employee, meaning they're paying for some of the burden and risk of the older employees with no choice to drop out.  Not to mention how many services aren't covered by insurance plans and how insane your deductibles can be. On many you have to pay 5k out of pocket for hospital services before anything is even covered by the plan you pay for, and thats assuming you are in the right network and seen by the right doctors and the procedures are ultimately deemed necessary and are covered by the insurance company and plan you have.  Second, your second paragraph agrees with what I said.   But I think our healthcare costs are artificially propped up partially because there is no mediator. The government providing healthcare would allow them to leverage mass purchasing of supplies and medicine and also control market costs of critical medical supplies.  This extrapolates the previous problem even further because so many people were forced into paying for health insurance in the new system and with the costs being outrageously high it multiplies the profit margins of those corporations.  This is asinine.	0

Actual legal answer.  No.     This is defined as subterfuge.  The act of using deceit in order to achieve a goal.  This applies to all sort of legal issues.  For example you buy a car for $6,000.  You can't just claim the car was a gift to a friend and the $6,000 was another gift to avoid taxes.  It's an obvious sale and you used deceit to circumvent the law.  Very illegal	0

They also had a 2-0 lead in ‚Äò94 and blew it. Both of those teams were arguably better than ‚Äò93. A.C. Green was a huge addition with a healthy Cedric Ceballos. Those years ripped my heart out as a 12 and 13 year old	0
Vince was an elite player for 10 years and a very good player and legitimately important piece for the Magic and Mavs. The NJ, Orlando, and Dallas teams were highly competitive and just didn't quite have the same firepower that a few other teams had during his prime years. I believe he should be a Hall of Famer, although he will never be regarded in the same light as other greats of his era, and rightfully so. He strikes me as the Superstar-esque tier. During his true prime you had guys like KG, Kobe, Dirk, Duncan, Tmac, etc. that were on the truly elite level,  he was second tier, but that doesn't mean he wasn't great.	0

Teen use of steroids increased from 5 percent to 7 percent over the same period, the survey found.  It's relatively common among American high schoolers. And among basketball prospects the use of HGH must be exploding with all the money at stake.	1

I would like to see Duncan carry that horrible Minnesota team for 12 years. Garnett was the reason why fans were coming to T-Wolves' games. He meant a lot to city of Minnesota and he knew that, thats why he didnt leave them for all those years. Never forget that legendary MVP season in 2004. where Garnett carried T-Wolves to the Conference Finals. Bill Russell said that if Garnett doesn't win a ring, he will give him one of his. Luckily Garnett got his well deserved ring in 2008. He even came back to play his last season in Minnesota. We will never see another player like Garnett. The Greatest PF in NBA history. A role model for millions NBA fans. Thank you Kevin for everything, and congratulations on becoming a HOFer.	0

">that this series was guided by refs is a widely-held opinion (that many have reinforced when they rewatch)  Shut the fuck up about my flair, dude. It's lame. And it's obvious I'm not claiming it was just you so idk what you're talking about  And it is a widely held opinion by mavericks fans mostly, check some videos about unbiased reviews from the series and you'd see many people realizing that other than G5, most of the ""phantom"" calls are way overblown. I bet you won't tho   Remember, bad officiating =/= rigging   Its funny that we have compilations of every bad calls from every other series, except 06. Again, you literally cannot make an argument that the refs guided G3, G4, G6. G5 was an anomaly, sure"	0

Neither of you all know very much I‚Äôm willing to bet and with all due respect I‚Äôve read no leagues across the globe in sports from soccer to American football to the nba speaking on no fans until a vaccine. Please stop the pessimistic views and let researchers find and develop treatments. And please before any predictions let‚Äôs see if we implement a system where we can test and monitor the virus and  hospitals can cope with the virus before they have to go into emergency crisis mode. This is much about having enough tests, tracing of COVID, research, and being able to handle patients while working on vaccines you understand.   Everyone with non factual based statements regarding sports and the coranavirus needs to stop predicting the fall and definitely 2021 while we are in the spring of 2020. The way this thing impacted society so quickly is the same way things may change for the better. Until then please chill with negative predictability shit you all have prolly done very little research on.	0

And again, I would be more concerned about these support numbers being higher than actual due to response bias.  Similar to how after Trump so many people got the courage to show their true hateful selves.  Another issue would be, who is actually being surveyed?  I would imagine a lot of people wouldnt want to be on these surveys (or cant for some reason), and they would likely not support gay marriage.

The test shit is so overblown. Most people don't need a test. The treatment is the same as a common flu. Rest + fluids, tylenol/NSAIDs for fever and aches, go to hospital if you have breathing issues or high/prolonged fever. Isolate yourself from others.  Getting a test does nothing for you beyond giving you something to post on twitter about. If you're sick stay home even if its not COVID-19. Testing at this point is only really useful on non-symptomatic people who won't know to quarantine otherwise. But, we can't test hundreds of millions of people every week so that's not ever going to be an option. Everyone should chill on the testing nonsense and just assume they have it if they get sick.	0

I work at a hospital and can attest that it has been a ghost town, was far busier in January, and that this is all smoke and absolutely no fire.   In official hospital emails they are even admitting that ‚Äútest results are not reliable.‚Äù  I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre testing for but based on my research it seems to show up in some percentage of all subjects anyway, or maybe even vestigial from a prior flu vaccination.   But one thing is certain, there are only ‚Äútest results‚Äù and rumors thereof; there is no actual deadly outbreak occurring and we are being forced participants in a worldwide drill that we didn‚Äôt sign up for.	0

Hey man! So awesome! I was a SLAM reader/subscriber from the late 90's until about 2009 or so. I'm from Hawaii, and I remember there have been a few high school players from Hawaii written about during that time.  Would it be possible to look some up?

**Will McGee, athletic director at Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary, lifelong friend:** I‚Äôve been playing basketball with ‚ÄôBron since we were 8, and he‚Äôs always been good. But some of the things he does now, he did back when he was a kid. If he took a hit or something, he would be down for a while. You don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs hurt or if he‚Äôs not.  We were in eighth grade, playing in the Indiana Black Expo tournament. Good tournament, we make it to the championship. And we‚Äôre getting our doors blown off. We‚Äôre losing by 20-plus. So he goes down, hard foul, because when you‚Äôre good they‚Äôre always trying to foul you hard. We‚Äôre pushing, trying to get people away from him, make sure he‚Äôs cool, and one of our coaches called us over, one of our assistant coaches, while our head coach was out there tending to him. I remember him distinctly saying, ‚ÄúNow, mind you, we‚Äôre still in this game. We gotta stay focused. LeBron may be hurt, or he may not be hurt. We don‚Äôt know. We don‚Äôt know, but we gotta keep playing.‚Äù  And we‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúAll right, he‚Äôs right, we gotta keep playing.‚Äù So we come back, tie the game. We end up going to overtime. LeBron missed the rest of the game, in regulation. But then in overtime he‚Äôs all right to play. Comes back, scores 20 points, maybe like 12 in a row. We end up winning by 10. And when I tell you we were laughing the rest of the way home after we won that tournament. He was like, ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt feel my arm or leg for a minute. But I knew I had to get back out there and help. I had to do something.‚Äù  We said, ‚ÄúYeah, after we tied it up, I bet you did want to bring it on home.‚Äù That is etched in stone in my head.  We were in practice one day and he went down and did that, and coach was like, ‚ÄúGet up! I get scared every time you go down. My heart drops every time you start rolling on the ground. Get up if you ain‚Äôt injured.‚Äù  Man, that‚Äôs been him. He takes his time getting up.  **George Hill, Milwaukee Bucks, former Cavs teammate:** When I think of LeBron, I don‚Äôt think of what he does on the court; I think of what he does off the court that makes him special. For me, the things he does as far as endorsement-wise, him having a Beats deal, making sure all of us have Beats, and numerous pairs of them. I think I have so many Beats, shitloads of them in my closet because we got so many. Him having that Thom Browne suit deal, getting all of us three suits and shoes and glasses and headphones to match the suits.  Stuff like that, that you don‚Äôt really read about or see about, I think that‚Äôs what kind of makes him special. It‚Äôs the thought, because he didn‚Äôt have to do none of that. He‚Äôs his own man and he doesn‚Äôt have to include us in anything, but he knows that we‚Äôre all a team and we‚Äôre all together and he looks out for his teammates a lot.  **Steve Kerr, Golden State Warriors coach, four-time Finals adversary:** I remember his rookie year, when he went to Cleveland, his rookie year was my first year broadcasting. My first year out of the league, and I went to do a game. And I met his mom, and his mom said, ‚ÄúSteve Kerr, you‚Äôre a bad man. I was like, ‚ÄúOK, that‚Äôs cool. LeBron‚Äôs mom just called me a bad man.‚Äù That‚Äôs a great feeling.  **Kevin Love, Cleveland Cavaliers, former Cavs teammate:** D-Wade has said it before and I hate that I have to quote him. But when we go international, which is obviously always Toronto, he won‚Äôt turn on his phone. It‚Äôs only WiFi. He‚Äôs the cheapest fucking guy. He‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs bullshit. I won‚Äôt turn on my phone.‚Äù He won‚Äôt turn on data roaming. He‚Äôll only go when we‚Äôre either at the arena or at the Shangri-La, ‚ÄúHey, what‚Äôs the WiFi?‚Äù Internationally and in Toronto, he‚Äôll never pay for it.  ***From Team Banana Boat ‚Ä¶***  **Chris Paul, All-Star, Oklahoma City Thunder, former Team USA teammate**: The night before Game 4 (of the 2007 Finals), that‚Äôs when his son was born. Bryce. Yeah, I was there. I was coming to the Finals games, so I was staying with him. It was my first or second year in the league, and we were at the house. And, Vannah (LeBron‚Äôs wife, Savannah) had gone to the doctor, and I think called back to the house and said, ‚ÄúI think my water broke,‚Äù or something like that. And me and him got in the car to go to the Cleveland Clinic. We were there all night. Me and LeBron, Randy (Mims), Mav (Maverick Carter), Rich (Paul) his mom, all of us.  We were there all night, and then just waiting for Bryce to be born. He had Game 4 of the Finals the next day. Man, we were playing cards, we were doing all types of stuff. We were waiting, waiting for Vannah to deliver the baby. I remember she had him late, and we went back to the house. It was late, late. Crazy. Obviously, they got swept the next day.  **Dwyane Wade, TV analyst, 13-time All-Star, former Heat, Cavs, Team USA teammate:** With LeBron, I got a chance to see him at his lowest, after the 2011 Finals. When it came to losing in the Finals with the Heat, and not living up to his own and everyone else‚Äôs expectations. I watched him take it all on the chin and pick himself up off the ground and embraced it all. He bet on his work ethic and pure love for the game.  **Carmelo Anthony, Portland Trail Blazers, 10-time All-Star, former Team USA teammate:** Him being better with his left hand than his right hand. He does everything. He throws with his left, he writes with his left. He does everything with his left. When you see stuff like that, when you see people that can do things the same with both hands, whether it‚Äôs sports or regardless of what it is, that‚Äôs a special person. I don‚Äôt know too many people who can do that. I know one other person, probably Russ (Westbrook). Russ writes with his left and does things with his left, then gets on the court and won‚Äôt go left (laughs). These guys are one-of-a-kind when it comes to that.	1

Any time a player scores a high volume of points, there are going to be plenty of fouls. If you go back to Wilt Chamberlain's 100 point night, he got 32 foul shots and made 28 (really good, especially for a person that was around 50% from the charity stripe).   But it is also said that Wilt's teammates kept fouling the other team, so they could get the ball back and allow Wilt to get to 100. I think if you are going to put an asterisk on Devin's 70 point night based on your argument, then there should be an asterisk on Wilt's 100 point performance.	0

Or put him as the center on defense his reach is so big that noone could actually attempt a throw bc nobody can throw this high and be accurate.	0

Off the backboard between the legs is objectively better than any dunk in the 88 contest.   Same with a 5‚Äô8 player jumping over a 7 footer.   Same with a behind the back dunk.   I can keep going, but the dunks in 88 are ass compared to what the players attempted over the past decade. Not every dunk attempt is a gimmick, and I agree, gimmick dunks are ass. But you‚Äôre a dumbass if you think the dunks in 88 are better than what we‚Äôve seen in the past decade. Most of the absolute greatest dunk contest dunks have been in the 00‚Äôs and 10‚Äôs not the 80‚Äôs.	1

What you guys don't understand is how broke Tillman Fertitta is right now.  Calling him a billionaire is misleading because he's as liquid as tile.  In fact, he's positioned about as poorly as you could be.  All of his primary revenue streams are literally shut down: restaurant, casino, hospitality, basketball.  He's highly leveraged.  He took out high interest loans against his hospitality businesses so he could buy the Rockets.  Les Alexander (former Rockets owner) also personally loaned him $175m to complete the Rockets sale.  And don't forget that he lost a huge Chinese revenue stream right before the season started.  Also, just to add insult to injury, the Thunder were actually better than the Rockets after the Russell Westbrook trade which is a reminder that the Rockets are on the books for mega max deals to Westbrook and Harden.  Tillman strikes me as the kind of guy to not pay in a circumstance like this anyway (if you've seen a few episodes of Billion Dollar Buyer, you get a feel for him) but he probably doesn't have the money to cough up as is.  Think about it - 1) if he's taking out high interest bonds on his primary companies that means his credit wasn't that good to begin with and he was illiquid and 2) he took out a $175m personal loan to complete the sale which means he didn't have that cash lying around.  Tilman is highly leveraged, all of his primary revenue streams have gone to 0 and will stay there for the next 2-3 months, all of his companies have taken a huge haircut in valuation (meaning he sells any right now and probably loses 20% off the top) and he has no cash on hand.  This man is positioned incredibly badly.  Like you'd almost have to try to be in a worse position.	0

Please stfu. Kyrie got injured in game 1 of 2015 finals and warriors won in overtime. Lebron and the cavs won games 2 and 3 in that series and were 2-1 up. Immediately the warriors figured it out and made adjustments he started complaining that he had no help. Lebron losst 3 straight games after going 2-1 up without kyrie and love. Even steve kerr said they didnt believe they could win it. He lost to an inexperienced team and yet said he didnt have help. He was supposed to be the chosen one and lost to a team led by an undersized 7th pick who was said to have tissue paper ankles..	0
Dude we are in a pandemic with a virus we don‚Äôt know much about. It has killed many young people and it has killed people without preexisting conditions. It has caused heart failure.

Rookie Scottie in the playoffs averaged 26 minutes in there 3-2 win in the first round. I never said Scottie was better as a rookie, than cj is now. More so I‚Äôm talking about team fit not individual talent. The bulls needed someone who could raise their overall defense to elite, given mjs dominance in volume on offense and defense. Pippen provided that bump at the time. CJ alone doesn‚Äôt raise the teams at both ends in the same way. With MJ, they didn‚Äôt need a lot pieces to compete, but they still needed pieces.	1

"I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.  Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called ""Linux"", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.  There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called ""Linux"" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux."	0

Wrong, I'm almost 40 so I grew up in the Jordan era and I'm very familiar with all the players and teams we're talking about. That 96 Supersonics team isn't beating the Warriors or Spurs teams that Lebron faced in any finals. That team was very good, but it wasn't historically great (they won a total of zero titles) - the Warriors and Spurs teams are. And yes Lebron would excel in any system, especially a Phil Jackson system, he's never played for a coach **remotely close** to the level of Phil.	1

Those picks could easily be more valuable than the thunders picks if they tried to contend for the next few years. Nobody has any idea what Houston or the clippers will look like in 3 years it would be supremely retarded to give 4-5 of those up for a very small chance at a championship. Just because nobody looks unbeatable doesn‚Äôt mean the thunder would become anywhere near championship favorites with Beal or Holiday. Not to mention you still have to match salaries meaning they‚Äôd have to give away a huge piece of the team no matter what.	0

LeBron will get another ring before he retires, whether it‚Äôs the next 2/3 years as the best player or not and he could‚Äôve had a chance at an MVP this year.

">Yet another monumentally moronic quote. Literally no GM thinks this way. They are doing their best to build contending teams. And you can find players capable of being good first options without being ""a top 5 player"". It's an asinine argument that you continue to make, and continue to be dead wrong on.  Prove it, history doesn't lie, they build with the best players they can get, there is always a 1-5% chance they can win without a top 5 player or one of their players develops into a top 5 talent due to being young. Keep ignoring statistics though. Why do you think the 3 favourites this year all have top 5 players on them? ofc teams like Miami, Boston etc could get to the ECF, but there is a tiny chance they win, its literally 3/40(if you are generous and count dirk and wade)  >I've said plenty, and refuted almost every one of your moronic arguments.

I sold Kelvin Benjamin Buffet Tickets   I figured it was a good time to share this story with the league being suspended. Might give someone a chuckle.   Also a much needed break from name and syllable rearrangement of player names.   I live in Chattanooga. Summer 2018 I was working at a convenience store near the discount Strip Club.   One night Kelvin literally walked in with 2 of his buddies. For whatever reason none of my coworkers and nobody in the busy store recognized him. He was peak incognito.   At first when he walked up to the counter my thoughts are the following.   Damn he‚Äôs big, big. Like BIG.   He has without a doubt raised the networth in this room by tens of cholesterol points.   I had to confirm it was him. Without appearing like a total creaming fanboy, I carefully scanned his hand.   Yes! It was a clogged artery. Holy Fuck!   Carotid artery also provided additional confirmation.   Kelvin has walked up to my register and is asking to purchase not one, not two, not 5 individual meals.   But 3 dozen buffet tickets. 5 plates come to one pack. That‚Äôs 180 PLATES.   3 Dozen! THAT IS EATING OLYMPICS RIGHT THERE.   Kel. Cause at this point in my mind we are buddies since our lives have taken drastically different turns to get to this one transaction.   He had a very very neat wallet. And for whatever reason, his wallet made the whole cashier section smell like high end smoked meats. Needless to say, thick people smell very very delicious.   He handed me a 10 100 dollar bills. I don‚Äôt remember what the exact amount was. But it was pretty close to 50 bucks worth of plates for that eating marathon he was gonna have.   Once I rang everything and handed him his plates. Time slowed down for a bit. Holy Fuck I‚Äôve interacted with a eating MVP.   I knew I only had this one chance. This one moment. This could be the last time I ever be in the same space as an NFL player.   I said the words that day that lead Kelvin Benjamin to have slightly more pep in his step.   I said with a chill down my spine and clench in my ass cheeks.   I said ‚ÄúHey. I like buttered crab legs‚Äù and he said Thanks and smiled.   Kelvin probably ate 25-30,000 calories that night. I gave the assist with the buffet. It was a good night.	1

Now that's actually a good question! I would argue that Trump failed to put the right people in charge. Those people failed to set proper expectations with the leaders of specific departments, namely ones that were keeping track of the spread of COVID-19. Those departments probably have about 5 or 6 layers of management before you get to the people with actual boots on the ground. Those people have probably been with the agency for 10-20 years and never thought COVID would get this crazy, and there's 10,000 policies and procedures for reporting to upper management, so the feedback loop from top to bottom of the organization was bad. Compound that with Trump saying it's not a big deal and you've got a cluster on your hands.   1. Setting the wrong people in charge was Trumps fault.   2. Having poor bureaucracy from people actually doing the work in the agency is a systemic problem with any public organization worth billions of dollars.	1

"Not even the point. We have seen three different explanations post festum... And then they zeroed it in on one, ""official and according to the rules"". And lmao, holy shit, its you again! üçª I wasn't clear enough... The rules say the whistle decides when game goes on and when it doesn't. This wasn't a continuation of the inadverted whistle, it was a change of possession after the inadvertent whistle. This ""shooting motion"" is an excuse that was used before - with different official explanations each time. How can you call a ""continuation play"" after player A goes for a layup, player B blocks the shot, ref whistles(incorrectly = makes a mistake), player C catches the ball and scores a put back... They ""inadvertently"" called a nonexistent basket - and finish the review saying that call was wrong, BUT the basket, that wasn't called during the action, gets confirmed 5 minutes after it was supposedly made - in a shooting motion already? Mavs lost 2 games on the same ""inadvertent call"" BS - buy 2 completely opposite official rullings on an unclear, flawed rule."	1

Birmingham is something like the 43rd biggest TV market in the country, and was the most consistent football TV market (i.e. highest rated) for 16 years in a row. It's a bigger media market than either Memphis or New Orleans, according to Nielsen.  Obviously there's no way to know if that would translate to NBA fandom. But again, there are no major pro sports teams in the market. So there wouldn't be any competition for eyeballs, once football is over.  As for metro size: https://moving.selfstorage.com/largest-metro-areas-without-major-league-sports-teams/  Top 10 isn't bad. Plus it's pretty clear Birmingham is the most sports-obsessed of any of that top 10.  I'm not saying it's a no brainer or anything. Obviously Seattle is the best candidate because the team is already wanted there. But Birmingham is a strong candidate for that second spot just because of the lack of competition by other non-football teams.	0

"[https://np.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/ezytd9/reasons\_that\_john\_paxson\_gar\_forman\_need\_to\_go/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/ezytd9/reasons_that_john_paxson_gar_forman_need_to_go/)  So without further ado, here are my reasons Garpax need to go:  In no particular order  * Cristiano Felicio Contract. He was 25 years old averaging 4 and 4. * Waiving Spencer Dinwiddie in favor of Michael Carter-Williams * Trading Tony Snell for Michael Carter-Williams * Letting Spencer Dinwiddie walk in favor of MCW * John Paxson choking Vinny Del Negro (His own hire), he would later be quoted ""What also disappointed me was that VDN never owned up to making a mistake"" * Fired Scott Skiles on Christmas Eve * Fired Bill Cartwright days after Thanksgiving after giving him mismatched rosters and under-preforming * Overruling This lobbying for Draymond Green to draft Marquis Teague * Refused or failed to take back salary and gather assets preferring to bet on player Development in Jabari Parker & Otto Porter JR * Tyrus Tomas for LaMarcus Aldridge * The biggest free agent signing of their tenure they almost immediately started drama with telling him he was no longer allowed to wear a headband. This policy would appear to be reverted years later w/ no explanation * Interviewed no one for the job of Head Coach but Jim Boylen & hired him. Worse several reporters (For example Vinny Goodwill) have alleged that this was like to have been planned since the summer beforehand. * Blindsided Hoiberg by firing him after showing up expecting to run practice. During his tenure here they fed him a steady stream of their personal projects & mandated them to receive playing time. None of these projects worked out. Examples are Jerian Grant, Cameron Payne, Joffrey Lavergne, Zipser, Felicio, etc. * Leaked that Derrick Rose was healthy to the media putting a ton of pressure on him to return in time for the playoffs & launching a wave of jokes that never really let up * Let Ron Adams go from Thibs Staff angering him & resulting in him going on to be the architect of the Warriors championship defense. He now has 3 rings. * Not trading Pau Gasol in 2015-16 where we would miss the playoffs and he would walk for nothing * Ran such a sloppy situation around Thibs firing that word reached Thibodeau Hoiberg would be his likely replacement while he was still coaching the team. Also serious speculation that this was told to players, undermining his authority as coach. * Thibs even being hired is a win for them right? No, they actually didn't want him. Tom Thibodeau was the recommendation of an outside group hired by Reinsdorf. John Paxson wanted Doug Collins and Gar Forman wanted Mike Brown. * Refused to hire Thibs strength & conditioning coach (Anthony Falsone) in Houston. He would later be hired and win the championship with the San Antonio Spurs in 2013-14. He still serves as their athletic director today. * Escorted Thibs out with security when he was fired. * Overpaid Fred Hoiberg 5 years /25 million and then fired him before it was complete. K.C. Johnson has speculated this is the reason why Jim Boylen remains. As, they don‚Äôt want to be paying two coaches not coaching at the same time. * Letting a lot of talent walk for nothing. To avoid the headache of having to defend each and every player in this group I‚Äôll make my case for the best and attach the rest as honorable mentions. Omer Asik is the biggest mistake. We had no backup 5 to replace him and Houston ended up getting an almost lottery pick for him later on so he was definitely moveable if we ever wanted out. Honorable mentions: Deng, Marco, E‚ÄôTwaun, the Bench mob. * Amnestied Carlos Boozer way too late to be able to matter * Leaked that Kris Dunn apparently wasn‚Äôt working hard enough over the summer * Failed to see the writing on the wall and instead of rebuilding committed us to that meaningless three alphas year just to do the same thing in the end. * The entire Doug McDermott situation can be made into like eight bullets and is stupidly controversial among Bulls fans. But I know there will be stans in the comments so I will let them defend Garpax. * Trading 17 & 18 for 11 in the 2013 draft  \*Using #11 to draft Doug Mcderrmott in a good draft.  * Dumping Doug Mcderrmott just two years later for basically nothing. * Were incredibly late to the game of analytics, frequently downplaying its importance. * Kevin O‚Äô Connor speculates that their promising to draft Chandler Hutchison restricted us from doing any draft night trades involving the #22 pick in 2018. Started our rebuild by selling a second- round pick. (We know Jordan Bell isn‚Äôt good, that‚Äôs never what this was about) * Third largest market in the NBA, paid the luxury tax twice. Traded for OPJ whose making 27 million and has played in 24/78 games available. If his girlfriend is reliable he‚Äôs also not a fan of the front office and a free agent in a year. * Horrible medical team. We‚Äôre always injured every single year. * Rosters frequently have big holes and they take bizarre steps to fix them. No Small Forward? Jabari. Need a long-term scoring option next to Rose? 33-year-old Rip Hamilton seems like a safe bet. (I love Rip but that doesn‚Äôt make it a good signing) Need a solid starting ball-handler & playmaker? Tomas Satorasnky, MCW, Jerian, Rondo seems like the wait maybe nvm. I know that you can‚Äôt nail every signing and not even all of these are bad. It‚Äôs more that there seems to be consistent gaps between how they evaluate talent & fit and that actually translates to the court. * 5 Playoff Series wins total in a 17-year tenure. * Had a Bulls doctor question Luol Deng about sitting out of games for a broken leg. * Dumped John Salmons and a first & second round pick to chase Lebron and ended up with nothing. * Trading Kirk Hinrich during his farewell tour for basically nothing. * Again, overruling Thibs when he liked Rudy Gobert for Tony Snell * Pulled the QO on David Nwaba for Jabari Parker. I feel like Nwaba while maybe not fantastic on his own fit really well with us. We‚Äôve been a worse team since he left. * Misused Lauri basically his entire time here. Maybe not directly because of this but it‚Äôs now being rumored that he wants out. * Traded Taj Gibson in a year we made the playoffs for Cameron Payne & Joffrey Lavergne. * Failing to net any assets at the 2020 trade deadline. * IMO have had serious questions regarding their drafting ability since now Orlando Magic assistant GM left in 2012. * Are alleged to use the media to trash players and coaches by [Van Gundy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I4Y4VyDqrs)  ETA: - Dwade contract  * Couldn't build around Jimmy * Bad player development, everyone is regressing save Zach * Had coaches spy on coaches/players (Randy Brown) * Failed to make Chicago a FA destination * Inherited the prestige Jordan gave us, made us a joke. * Threatening to give Jimmy Butlers minutes to Tony Snell when he refused a contract extension."	0

Meh I did the math on the wrong year. But tbh I really dont care that harden got roughly 100 more points for the season in an era where scoring is drastically higher than it was in wilts era. Also what did harden win that year? Oh yea an all nba selection. That's it. No mvp. No chip. According to analysts he wasnt even the best player in the nba that year, much less had a better season than the GOAT center...long story short. Harden is not even close to the most valuable player in the nba currently, much less the best ever...go homer him some more, maybe make like a beard subreddit or something so you can go jerk off in a circle with all the other guys that like watching the pace of a game where one player takes 30 free throws.	1

"A homeless person after treatment isn't homeless. Its a person in treatment, living in a halfway home perhaps. If you're imagining a ""bum"" off the streets going to a job interview at mcdonalds then you're only thinking in extremes here and not realistically. There are plenty of people who work in mcdonalds who are in treatment: therapy, 12 step program, rehab, you name it. This would be more of the same.   Furthermore, you have to have a better argument than ""being homeless gives you PTSD"". That's not in official literature and the only people who say that as far as I know are people who aren't medical professionals giving their opinion. aka biased takes on the issue.   Your last paragraph is where your opinion clouds your judgement imo. You start off strong by talking about parking spaces. Read this post from 2 years ago to substantiate your knowledge. Read it. https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/6lvwh4/im_an_architect_in_la_specializing_in_multifamily/.   But, your overall main premise is wrong, and I'll tell you why.   The main problem isn't nimbys and blocking homeless shelters, its not giving people with drug addiction and mental illness treatment FIRST. These are diseases of the mind that CANNOT be treated on your own. You need professional help from experienced medical professionals, preferably in a psychiatric setting. Its the same way you need a heart surgeon to perform a bypass surgery on you. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. That's it, bottom line kind of thing.  If you build all the shelters and affordable housing your heart desires (which will never happen btw because the free market controls these things, not govt initiatives) then it will still be a failure because housing is NOT a treatment for schizophrenia or drug addiction. Its a recipe for disaster to give schizophrenics a free house. They'll think govt spies are outside, meaning they'll never leave the house and suffer from malnutrition because they don't go grocery shopping. Many homeless people in their current state CANNOT TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES. They need professional help first before anything else, and you don't understand this because you're only looking at this from a housing POV, which is a failure of perspective.  I've read articles about formerly homeless people being given these houses and they couldn't pay their bills, keep the house clean, or generally hold their shit together. It was a disaster. This was in the NY/NJ area.   You need to stop thinking in terms of housing and nimbys. Its liberal talking points for people who don't know anything about drug addiction or mental health beyond what they read in headlines, which I think you may fall into. I'm lucky enough to be a medical professional so I know a bit more about this, which is where my POV comes from. I've been involved in a psychiatric hospital (on the treatment side) that treated plenty of homeless people, which is why I know how treatment plans work. Everything I described is what I've seen with my own eyes. If I asked you what % of homeless people have drugs in their tox screens, your first guess would always be under what the actual answer is, for example.   I do not mean to denigrate you. You have a lot of great points here. A lot. And you know what you're talking about. I just fave minor disagreements."	0

Everyone so far is saying it's the Warriors but the Spurs need some consideration too. This was their most mediocre season they've had since Pop took over and it was looking like they wouldn't make the playoffs, ending their 22 year streak. If the season is cancelled, they won't miss the playoffs and they will keep their streak alive. They will have to do better next year tho because honestly wtf happened to the Spurs this year.	0

Or, alternatively, Kobe destroyed all good will with Shaq by dragging his name through the mud during Kobe's rape scandal, and destroyed what could have been the greatest franchise of all time because he made it clear he would leave for the Clippers if they didn't let Shaq go.  Kobe ran one of the best players in league history out of town because he couldn't handle being second banana and because he was a nightmare of a human being.  Its all in the story you want to tell.   The Kobe deification on this sub is absolutely insane.  If you're judging toxic locker room behavior, its pretty hard to beat accusing your teammate of squashing sexual assault allegations with payouts in a legal deposition.  And the idea the 2013 Knicks could have won anything is ludicrous.   Melo dragged that team into the second round by force of will alone.   His teammates were Iman Shumpert, JR Smith, Raymond Felton, a 80 year old Marcus Camby, Tyson Chandler on half a leg, and exactly zero useful NBA players other than that.  The fact they were even in that Pacers series shows how amazing Carmelo was at his peak, that team was fucking garbage.  It would (ironically) be like if Dame had taken the Blazers to the second round without Nurkic and Collins this year.	0

China certainly has their issues but they're not the reason the US has the highest death toll from COVID-19 in the world right now.  I agree with Lin, we should stop with the finger pointing. We need to take action and demand that those in office take action. We need to be proactive because simply looking for someone to blame is just a distraction, and let's be honest, a lot of it is rooted in racism. I've seen some pretty disgusting things said about China and their people and this idea that they need to be punished seems to only stoke racial tensions.	0

Joe Rogan disagrees with y‚Äôall lol, I think I‚Äôll value his opinion over the dribble in here. Lebron is arguably the best athlete in the world... faster and stronger at his weight than anyone else in the league, I don‚Äôt know much about hockey but if this guy is the same weight and height as lebron as it says I highly doubt anyone in here knows enough to say he‚Äôs stronger, let alone waaaay stronger than lebron?? Lebron might be the strongest athlete at his weight not counting bodybuilders. And you seriously believe if they were going to have a Logan Paul vs ksi type showdown where each of them could train for a lil while so the fighting experience would be a even playing field, that lebron wouldn‚Äôt have a chance? Y‚Äôall clearly smoking crack üòÇffs have y‚Äôall seen what that man can do with his body? If he was a mma fighter instead of basketball no one would be surprised if he was the ufc heavyweight champion. Think I‚Äôm full of shit? Y‚Äôall know who the real ufc heavyweight champion is rn? Another guy from Ohio, stipe miocic, him and lebron support each other and before stipe became a mma fighter and then heavyweight champion, he was just a great d1 baseball player. But with a background in wrestling, great fight iq, and incredible athleticism for his size, he was able to become arguably the best heavyweight fighter we‚Äôve seen so far. (Yes there‚Äôs more to it than that, but I see no reason why you‚Äôd assume lebron wouldn‚Äôt have the same intangibles necessary.)Which technically puts Stipe in the conversation for baddest man to ever liveüòÇand he would have a valid argument to that. Even boxers concede mma is more of a realistic fight, and the baddest man on the planet went from being heavyweight champion boxer in the 90‚Äôs (Mike Tyson), to now everyone acknowledging that the ufc heavyweight champion is considered the baddest man. You know what stipe‚Äôs thoughts on if lebron did mma were when someone asked him right after he won the belt? Thank god that he doesn‚Äôt cuz I‚Äôd be out of a job üòÇnot verbatim but you get the point. I‚Äôm a huge fan of ufc and that topic of what sports players in other sports would be good fighters is debated a lot by the Sports analysts , and lebron is easily the athlete that‚Äôs brought up the most. Why? Because simply his level of athleticism is uncharted territory in combat sports, that, combined with his very high iq (ask anyone) , skill and agility unprecedented for his size in the nba let alone the ufc,while fighting heavyweights who the majority of which will be smaller than him, slower reflexes, weaker, less durable, less explosive? And trust me, you can‚Äôt even rely on being more skilled or fighting more intelligently, he‚Äôs the sports player of the decade for more than just his athleticism. Honestly, it would be a foolish bet to assume if this dude did decide to go the mma route when he was a kid, that he wouldn‚Äôt be competing against the best of the best, and prolly winning against those niggas too. And even now, if he had even a month training,  with the martial arts he already did(y‚Äôall niggas didn‚Äôt consider that either did ya?) he would work any 43 year old non professional fighter who wants itüòÇthis dude is supposed to compete against a dude a decade younger than him who if the ages were reversed would prolly still be more athletic than you?üòÇcome on now y‚Äôall asking to much of my guy chara, I peeped some of his fights and mans can scrap but he‚Äôs already had enough concessions keep him away from bron lol let my man rest his wife prolly going through menapause    https://youtu.be/9viiFzuchoo	0

Because you're equating regular season stats with finals. It's disingenuous to assume a player will replicate their regular season stats in the playoffs and especially the Finals. He averaged 24 his first MVP season so your point is garbage anyway.   Curry has always been a high turnover player. Him playing recklessly is what makes his game a huge tradeoff between explosive plays and devastating mistakes. Calling that out as if it's a singular event is also disingenuous.   Lastly, assists are only counted if the player makes the shot. Using that as a metric without looking at how bad everyone else played is also nonsense. Go back and watch how many open shots were whiffed by Barnes, Iggy, and Thompson.   Everyone played down. Curry wasn't great, but saying he massively choked is a straight up delusional argument. You're looking for some kind of legitimate excuse to hate on him when the truth is there isn't really. This is painfully obvious by the fact your initial reasoning for hating on Curry is that he threw his mouthpiece. If you want to hate, go ahead. But don't act like your reasons come from anything based in reality.	0

Easy to trash draft picks with 20/20 hindsight. They definitely should have just drafted another James Harden after trading him. Wow, Presti sure is a clown.	1

I get you're insecure about your financial future but putting your hands over your ears and yelling ""bIlLiOnAiRrEs bAd"" isn't going to help. At the end of the day hyper capitalism has made improvements that vastly outweigh the negatives that come along with it. Nordic countries, and Canada greatly benefit from a lot of the innovation, and production that happened in the US, by profit seeking individuals. It is not the reserve currency for the rest of the world for no reason. For someone very learned on this topic you seem to not know much at all.   Canadian btw and while I love our healthcare system, I am not retarded enough to ignore the obvious benefits of capitalism and even aggressive capitalism. We directly benefit from their private medical sector where we can benefits from their developments in technology and medicine without any of the R&D costs. Unlike you I at least recognize the benefits of socialism, where your arguments are coming from some deep insecurity where you want to pretend profit seeking motive is fundamentally terrible."	0

As someone in finance, but also intensely dislike Ferttita because how cheap he is with the Rockets, I understand where he‚Äôs coming from. He may have the label of $4.5bn, but his businesses are extremely cash flow poor now. He‚Äôs already levered to the hilt from buying the Rockets, and no bank is going to lend him even more money to help pay for employees.   I hope he does the right thing and can find the cash to pay for the workers, OR even better, if the US govt can steal a play from the UK and offer to reimburse 80% of furloughed worker‚Äôs wage. That would make a true difference to the economy.	1

Wade no doubt. This isn‚Äôt even a question. Whoever says KD is fucking retarded and only started watching basketball within the past few years   People forget KD was just a tall James harden before he joined a 73 win team that won a title and made 3 finals without him. His playoff efficiency ALWAYS drastically dipped compared to the regular season and he always had his worse series in the biggest games and moments   KD **WISHES** he could have have the run Dwade had in 2006   Put Dwade on those warriors teams instead of KD and they would have gone 16-0, 16-1 in both of their playoff runs  Put Trevor Ariza on those teams instead of KD and they still win at least 1 title lol that‚Äôs how stacked KDs team was   If this was asked in 2016 it would be overwhelmingly wade. It‚Äôs sad that so many retarded people got duped by KD on golden state thinking he could perform like that in the playoffs on any other team. Dude was getting the defensive attention of a role player	0
Imagine how good someone who becomes a star in the NBA was when they were a kid.

That's not the correct response and some kids wont do that, that's how you get LeBron and Steph and Tim Duncan who are so great at fundamentals. They were coachable. But not everyone is like them.	0

And with that comment, you‚Äôve either ousted yourself as a troll, or completely inept. LeBron is, quite simply, the greatest all-around athlete to ever step on a basketball court.   Really there is only one comparison to be made. The only person with similar size, strength and speed was Wilt Chamberlain. Larry Bird was a phenomenal player, but if you‚Äôre denying LeBron has a massive athletic advantage over Bird at any time in his career, you‚Äôre delusional.	0

MLB learned its lesson after the McCourt saga, where it allowed him to buy the Dodgers when he didnt actually have many (if any) liquid funds. Instead, it allowed him to use real estate he owned, including the parking lot next to Dodgers Stadium, as collateral for financing. Of course, eventually he couldn't meet the payroll. Rules were changed so new owners had to have certain liquidity to be able to purchase a team. The NBA should have never allowed someone who theoretically was asset rich, but cash poor, to buy a team, and utilize as much debt on his future personal finances. You can use debt to buy a team, but you need that person can actually provide liquid funding if need be. And that's before you dig further into Fertitta/his family's finances. Then you learn they truly don't have any cash on hand	0

Kareem is lucky he peaked in the crack-infested '70s or he would have faced the same fate running into the Celtic dynasty year after year. He also became quite frail in his mid '30s, never averaging 10 rebounds a game or more from age 34 on. Surely a point of saltiness when compared to Wilt's greatness.  Ultimately, Wilt is *the* reason why Kareem is not looked at as the greatest, at immortality. How can you be if you're not even the greatest of your position?	1

Simmons. I think his ceiling is simply higher. I also think that even as is, a team with him as it‚Äôs centerpiece could win more. He‚Äôs the best defensive guard in the league this season, or at the very least top 2-3. He also provides elite playmaking, he‚Äôs huge and athletic as all hell. Put Ben Simmons on a team like the Bucks where he can drive and kick to shooters and he would dominate. I honestly think that if Brett changed up how he uses Ben and Joel we could be a much better team than we are now.	0

Iam asking you that. Since you brought up an article of a Asian guy getting attacked. I can bring up many more articles of Asian shop owners beating up black women, killing black people and even the large Asian protest to support Peter Liang murdering and unarmed innocent black man. If White People did that, they would get called Nazis or Charlottesville neo Nazi Riot. So why should Black People fight for people like that which shit on the very people whose backs are the reason they got over here in masses post Civil Rights Era. Foundational Black Americans are the main supporters of the Asian films and Asian businesses in America from the 70s to the Present. Yet to have a massively disrespectful protest to support a Asian cop killing an innocent unarmed Black Man, is totally racist and out of line, but yet want to cry racism when White Supremacist turn on them. They have to hold their own pair on this. Trump is going to do what he has to do. Stop looking at us Foundational Black Americans to fight your battles when none of them come to respect ours.	0

What do they do if an outbreak develops while they're at this 'neutral' location?  All you need is for one person to test positive and that'll more than send people into a frenzy. It's not as simple as just quarantining them.  If an NBA player tests positive, it means they've had it at least for 2-14 days (since it seems we're only testing people when exhibiting symptoms) and could've spread it to anyone within that time period. That means family, coaches, teammates, other players - who will all need to be tested now.   The optics of this is absolutely horrible for the NBA - wasting limited test kits so that basketball can finish this season is absurd. And if it's a 'neutral' city that develops an outbreak because the NBA moved there, the perception of the NBA would become worse than the NFL	0

I agree.  A 400 DL is chicken shit any HS kid finished with puberty can do within 6 mos of training.   500 is something someone with  average ability can train to.  If he trained for he, he would DL in the 700s at least, but considering he's playing bball, ill say 455 bench, kevin durant benched 315,  mid 600 DL, 500 to 600 sq if it's a full range squat, a lot more in a powerlifting style squat to parallel.   These are conservative.  He could play on an nfl defensive line.  Throw bball player numbers out the window, he isnt built like a basketball player.	0

"In retrospect, when I look back I realize my parents raised me very well. However, when I was a kid, I thought the opposite. My parents gave me so much advice that I started tuning it out. I 100% would've listen to a celebrity I looked up to's social media post more than my parents. Kids on the cusp of puberty and teenagers are simply hardwired to be rebellious, they listen to people who they think are ""cool"" instead of their parents. There are literally countless books, movies, and real anecdotes about kids and teenagers refusing to listen to their parents, about following what the ""cool"" people do, it's just what happens.  You clearly do not have any children over the age of 10 if you think kids not listening to their parents are a result of them not being raised properly. Don't fucking act like you know how to raise a child ""correctly"" when you've never raised one yourself, you pompous ass.

Time to ban large gatherings.  This is NOT your seasonal flu. 20% of those that get COVID-19 require hospitalization and 15% require supplementary oxygen.     The transmission rate is also significantly higher at 3 to 7 for every one person infected. Flu is super small compared to that.  Only reason numbers are not bigger is because states has NOT been testing like other countries. Only 500 tests done vs 30000 in South Korea and 20000 in Italy.  Can't find infected without tests.  And young people with no underlying conditions have died, death rate is 2%.  Not to mention you do not know long term effects, given its been shown to attack kidneys and other organs.  And if you have hospitals overwhelmed and over capacity there is no where to get help for any illness!!!	1

"> And don't tell me I don't know about economics systems and history lmao... I can guarantee you I'm well more learned on this topic than you.  Oh boy lol  You're an idiot. I was going to respond with some stats to blow your mind, that Michigan in fact is far better in standard of living than the rest of the world, but I am realizing you are probably a troll and just wasting time.   I get you're insecure about your financial future but putting your hands over your ears and yelling ""bIlLiOnAiRrEs bAd"" isn't going to help. At the end of the day hyper capitalism has made improvements that vastly outweigh the negatives that come along with it. Nordic countries, and Canada greatly benefit from a lot of the innovation, and production that happened in the US, by profit seeking individuals. It is not the reserve currency for the rest of the world for no reason. For someone very learned on this topic you seem to not know much at all.   Canadian btw and while I love our healthcare system, I am not retarded enough to ignore the obvious benefits of capitalism and even aggressive capitalism. We directly benefit from their private medical sector where we can benefits from their developments in technology and medicine without any of the R&D costs. Unlike you I at least recognize the benefits of socialism, where your arguments are coming from some deep insecurity where you want to pretend profit seeking motive is fundamentally terrible."	0

"I hate doing this, and I'm sorry if it's slightly off-subject in the sense it isn't related to the NBA, but I just want to get this message out in case it protects anyone else (or their mothers) from comas and ventilators: Please do not shop at Mattress Firms across the country (USA) until this is over. It is not a sanitary - and therefore safe - environment to put yourself in during the current ongoing pandemic.   Local leadership in my area made this and asked us to post it to social media:  https://imgur.com/EWSJKr  No matter how sarcastic or tongue-in-cheek that image must seem, I assure you, it's not. :(  They held a video conference yesterday (3/24) advising all employees that even in the event the government specifically declares them as NOT exempt from a shelter in place order, they will challenge it.  Because the corporate honchos in Houston know more than the governments, scientists, and doctors around the world urging people to stay home and flatten the curve.  As part of the official company response, we have been instructed to post ""cleaning logs"" around the store that we sign to ""prove"" we clean the stores twice a day.   Cleaning supplies are low and none are available in local grocery stores. Corporate gave everyone a $50 credit for Office Depot online, which has also been OOS on everything. When asked on the conference call what to do when the supplies available do run out, we were told to ask our DMs to buy some locally.  Think about how many beds and pillows the average customer touches and lays on while picking out a new bed. And then please consider the staggering amount of Lysol/ Clorox cans a store would need to have stocked up in the back to constantly sanitize each and every surface that is touched. Granted, we do offer pillow protectors - that are kept stacked in an open-to-the-air box and touched by every single guest who goes to grab one. Now finally ask yourself if you still feel like that is a truly sanitary environment to shop in right now?  Don't worry though, there's some great news! If you get sick while working this essential position, you get unpaid furlough and no disaster/emergency pay. Also they froze accrued PTO so no sick pay either. But they can't get supplies out to these essential businesses and employees to keep them sanitized and safe to work in.   It's not only unethical, I believe it is (or at least should be) illegal. They are actively fighting against flattening the curve just so they don't lose even more sales than they already have."	0

"First of all, Kobe's death has nothing to do with difficulty running the league. Yes the China thing was difficult but the NBA as a whole, at least the way Silver has ""run"" it, is much easier. Let the players do whatever they want (i.e. constantly demanding trades) then lament about the players doing whatever they want, make a bunch of political PR statements and fans eat it up, your on-court product is terrible but fans don't care. That's what makes it the easiest league to run. Also the coronavirus decision wasn't a difficult decision, it was literally the only decision he could make.

I never said anything about Westbrook nor did I say or imply it was the entirety of this sub. It's just ironic for the dudes who match my description (I guarantee you are plentiful on here) to be bold enough to characterize NBA players as mentally weak and bitches without looking in the mirror.  You wouldn't insult a cashier while waiting for the food you paid for but society has decided it's acceptable in the realm of pro sports- and that's okay as there are much objectively worse things in this world deserving of outrage. But if fans are going to provoke players it's fair game for the players to exercise their authority.	1

Scottie didn‚Äôt have to be that elite to get them over the hump. They needed other defensive options to cover for their lack of a true defensive center imo. Either way I don‚Äôt think they win as many games or as good of a team without pippen. They might not have made the 2nd round at all without pippen his rookie year in my opinion. It was more about team fit.  Sorry I am having a busy day thought you were arguing some angle relating to clutchness, with how you mentioned CJ in your first comment saying he is a better fit for a conference title team than 2nd year Scottie pippen is to Jordan	1

Mullin never went deep into the playoffs.  Ewing, Malone, Drexler, Barkley, these were the guys MJ stepped on to win rings.  And whom Magic and Bird stepped on before.  The difference IMO between Barkley and the rest of em, is Barkley felt if he had help like Pippen and PJ, he‚Äôd have won the same as MJ.  The Dream Team gave him the chance to demonstrate it.  Drexel matched up head to head with MJ so had no disillusions.	0
KD wouldn‚Äôt have missed this entire season, Klay would have been healthy, Lowry would actually be recognized as a clutch player, Kawhi would still leave for the Clippers, KD would still leave for the Nets and the Nets would be a top team in the East, the Warriors would probably be a playoff team as well but not the same villains that they were. Also curry probably wouldn‚Äôt have missed the majority of the season, but the warriors still would have traded Russell for Wiggins.	0

The comments here are strange. The issue isn't about what is or isn't factual. We all know the virus originated in China. The issue is that Trump is making an obvious effort to re-brand the virus. He had been calling it coronaivrus and then suddenly made a pivot after beginning to receive criticism. If the Chinese moniker sticks, it becomes easier to shift blame from the administration and their lackluster (to put it kindly) response. The name change is just step 1 of a public relations strategy.	0
And I think whining and complaining about people giving valid criticisms is ultimately more useless. Go figure? I'll call out bullshit when I see it all day. Just like I'll call out yours. Have a nice day and go fuck yourself!	0

Unfortunately, no matter how hard a person might *consciously* try to treat every person the same way and avoid prejudice based on appearance, it's impossible to avoid feeling what's been embedded into one's subconscious mind.

Yes.  I am the moron.  Not the one making subjective arguments on something people agree shouldn't be subjective.

I guess the Raptors should have an asterisk because KD was injured and Klay went down in a key last stretch.   I guess the year the Nash Suns got suspended for a make or break game shoulda just cancelled the season.  And really, I guess you are a diehard Lebron/Cavs fan or something.

playoff stats up to that point:  #KOBE >26/5/5 on 45/34/82 shooting, came off the bench in 20 of those playoff games  #Lebron >29/8/7 on 46/32/74 shooting, started every game and didn't get carried by shaq (the version of shaq lebron got was barely worthy of starting, he had a bad year)  kobe and lebron were seen in the same way back then. yeah kobe had the TEAM achievements but he had the better TEAMS and TEAMMATES  they ran those kobe/lebron puppet commercials because both of them were faces of the league.  lebron never had to pass kobe because kobe was never seen as better than lebron. i feel like a lot of folks forget that kobe spent a lot of time coming off the bench and being a role player in his early years and lebron was the best player on his team after the 1st game of his career	0

Cuomo is still against shutting down business. They deem it okay for me to goto work in a building with 500 plus people.

Also all state workers are allowed to work from home but his office said that temps must stay in state offices if they want to get paid.

Not sure why included 2pt% and rebs when the difference is negligible. And the per game scoring and assist numbers for Harden are wildly bloated because he plays in a system where he's allowed to dominate the ball on every possession.

I guess it is the purpose of this post, use the gravity argument to tell us KD scoring was just Steph impact or Steph was just the most impactful player. KD doesnt need Steph to score 50 points. And if you think KD is an afterthought go look at what Lou Williams and Pat Bev said about defending KD in this series. Every top point god has that type of gravity, the problem is that they don't have a playmaker like Draymond to make them pay. Just take James harden and Lilliard. Harden get double team all the team but when he gives the ball to Tucker, the ball stays stuck and there is no action. Or take Lilliard against the pelicans in the playoffs, he got double teamed all serie by jrue and rondo, and when he gives the ball nobody knows how to move the ball to find the open man. So those plays that draymond does ain't easy and few power forwad can make it. So this gravity is effective also because of draymond ability to make each time the right play.  I am sure Steph gravity is a real thing but don't tell me he was the best player in this serie.	0

Those picks could easily be more valuable than the thunders picks if they tried to contend for the next few years. Nobody has any idea what Houston or the clippers will look like in 3 years it would be supremely retarded to give 4-5 of those up for a very small chance at a championship. Just because nobody looks unbeatable doesn‚Äôt mean the thunder would become anywhere near championship favorites with Beal or Holiday. Not to mention you still have to match salaries meaning they‚Äôd have to give away a huge piece of the team no matter what.	0

One time I had a crazy early 6am meeting planned with u/kwryan07 to go over some expense reports on Excel. He was known for getting to work early and putting in extra data entry before his day even started, so I decided I'd show up at 5am and impress him. I figured I'd easily be there first.  So I manage to roll in at 5am, and when I got there I see one desk lamp on. I walked over and saw him just entering crosstab after crosstab. I couldn't believe it. He was drenched in sweat and didn't even acknowledge my presence. The cleaning crew was there, and when I asked them, they said he'd been there since 3am just crunching numbers. What a legend. He truly Excelled in anything he put his mind to.	1
Dray is significantly more important to the Warriors success than Klay is though.  He is a much better defender(in a more important role on defense) and is their main playmaker after Steph.	0
I mean if he didnt want us see it he shouldn't have posted it online.  Once you post something on the internet it's gonna be there forever.  Using this rule in this context is wack.

I don't understand how this would work for seniors who have enough units/credits to graduate.

Specially if you have a low probability of getting drafted, even with one more year under your belt.	0

> because no number I‚Äôll ever say will change your mind  Because you've already clearly laid out you have no idea what a vertical is or how it's measured.    > that's not how we determine vertical because you're not standing perfectly upright like you are when we measure standing reach. You lean your body back when you're jumping from a running start, that's where the other 2 inches go  Yeah that's all complete bullshit.  NFL, NBA, college basketball, it's all measured the same way.   Someone stands on the ground, touches the highest point they can.  Then they jump and touch the highest point they can.  The difference is your vert.  It's as simple as it gets, the only differences is now they use a vertec, which just sets the measurement at the right height for the player but it's the same principle.   > it's almost like there's a reason we don't use standing reach to determine vertical. I'm not sure if you know this, but when you jump from a running start, your body isn't 100% upright.  Just blatantly wrong.  How are you arguing this?  [You realize there's a ton of video from NBA and NFL combines, right?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMz1CKMOLr4)  > can literally see his feet that far off the ground in the video  No one can be this dumb^.  You don't measure a vertical from the ground because legs aren't straight in the air.  I didn't jump higher just because I bent my knees more.  > Unless you have another source I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and trust the multiple measurements that have been done.   What multiple measurements?  We have his standing reach, the only other number we need is max reach.  In the video they said that was 12' 4.5 inches.  Please link me anywhere else his vertical was measured.	1

Yes? Youre not thinking clearly if you think otherwise.  Exposing more people to corona means that they get it and it goes away after some time and develop immunity/resistance to it, or in some cases they die.   If we wanted corona to pass over faster then we would've never quarantined, however it would also put a huge strain on hospitals and it would result in way more deaths so obviously it wouldnt be the smartest idea to do that.	0

If Italy is the worse case, the avg age of those that died is in the 80s.   People *need* to go back to work. Millions live paycheck to paycheck - they cannot just not work. Unrest can lead to looting and violence, which can also overload the system.  Again, you have very little life experience to understand the downstream effects. Your view is myopic - you only understand the hysteria in front of you, and you immediately jump to the worst case scenario *as your base case*. A complete fallacy.	0

Most of us are dead or dying, but I guess most would say life is good.  Humans figured out how to not kill each other or the earth‚Äîso on paper we‚Äôre lookin‚Äô great.  Funny little brains we have though‚Äîsure, the bombs don‚Äôt drop anymore, but it seems humans need a common conflict to exist.  We are a restless species.  And, sure enough, we settled on our new common conflict in practically no time at all‚Äîironic, isn‚Äôt that?‚ÄîThat the only thing we can agree on is what to fight over? Like I said‚Äîfunny little brains.  So, yeah, we still have bombs‚Äîof course we do‚Äîwe‚Äôre humans.  The bomb isn‚Äôt forewarned with sirens and followed by twisted flesh anymore though. Now the bomb attacks from within‚Äîuntil half your family, half your friends, half your liver...fuck‚Äîmight as well be half your rotten mind‚Äîthe bomb gets everyone.  A common human conflict just how we like it.  My mother died the night the Bucks won the 2020 championship‚Äîtragic‚Äîon a day that should have been pure joy, my mother died of a broken heart.  That broke everything. It was the last day I ever talked to my father. It was all just to much for him‚Äîthe highs and lows, the money, the slumps‚Äîjust too much. I guess my experience draws some parallels to his too‚Äîstrange as that may sound.  It‚Äôs not special though. We‚Äôre just like every other family, every political party, every book club, every homeowner‚Äîhundreds of millions of families quit on each other over the same thing that week. Pretty quick, people quit on themselves‚Äîleft clinging to their ideals while they slept alone and hardened.  Anyway, I don‚Äôt think I have anything else to say about life. I still don‚Äôt know why you wanted to hear about me. Like I said‚Äîain‚Äôt nothin‚Äô unique ‚Äòbout me. Not since then and not when I die‚Äîwe all die that one way or that other way ever since then‚Äîyou know how it goes.  My father died that one way‚Äîhe left me one thing in his will: a cramped storage unit that was late on rent and filled with trash cans. I didn‚Äôt even have to look‚Äîa I knew what the label on every single damn one of them said: ‚ÄúKhris Middleton.‚Äù  I hope that mean old fuck is burning in hell, because I‚Äôm sure as hell dying that other way‚Äîthe right way‚Äîknowing Khris Middleton was a legitimate second-option superstar and the Bucks would not have won the 2020 NBA championship without him.  Kha$h fuckin‚Äô Money ‚Äòtill my last breath‚Äîwhich should be any minute now, so how ‚Äòbout you let me get back to dying, because I‚Äôve got nothing to prove‚Äîjust like James.	1

I was never really high on either, but dwight did lead a team to the finals. Embiid seems like he needs to grow up a bit more (kinda same with old dwight?) but embiid seems like he really wanta to win. Dwight seemed to lack that according to alot of his teamates pre lebrons lakers. That all being said, id take dwight. This could easily change if joels team situation changes and he can play more in the post and take less 3s.	0

Lebrons teammates screwed him SO HARD at the end of that game. Here‚Äôs the final play made by every starter besides Lebron.  Kevin Love - On the play before the Hill free throws the Cavs are winning by 2. Kevin Love makes one of the most disgusting soft fouls ever. Probably the worst foul committed in the history of the Cavs franchise, given what it meant. Steph gets an EASY and 1 to put them up by 1. This foul was literally just as bad as the Ginobili v Dirk foul but nobody remembers it because of what else happened.  George Hill - next play Hill misses the FT. Now I‚Äôm not too mad about this because that‚Äôs fucking hard to do, making both free throws in that situation. Idc if it‚Äôs MJ, KD, Dirk, or anyone in between. Hitting free throws at the end of a finals game is Not easy. That being said he‚Äôs still an 80% FT shooter who missed.  JR Smith - didn‚Äôt know the score of the game somehow,, and then lied about it, also tried to point the finger at Lebron.  Tristan - tried to start a fight with Draymond  If Lebron didn‚Äôt know he was leaving,he knew after that. Literally every starter besides him did something retarded to end that game.	0

Seemingly a lot more suburban kids are in the NBA now outside of just kids of ex pros. Didn‚Äôt used to be as common. Also many more foreign players from all backgrounds   But anyway AAU is the same collective scam The NCAA runs but at high school level. It‚Äôs really picked up a ton the last 2 decades. They do events sponsored out the ass by the biggest shoe companies and invite x amount of heralded kids or teams for any given event and do it strenuously enough that many American prospects are known for a long time.   Many of the kids are stars while still in high school now so they have crazy media coverage themselves, it‚Äôs not a rare thing like when Lebron was in HS  The only players you can‚Äôt account for are late bloomers which are pretty common in the NBA, and then all the foreign players in the league now too (outside of the obvious lottery picks) that you can‚Äôt scout as extensively (Jokic and Giannis for example )	0

"Names themselves are never racist, sexist, etc. in isolation. The word ""faggot"" itself is not homophobic, and ""bitch"" is not misogynistic. It's how those words have transformed over time to demonize specific groups of people that make them bad. In other words, context matters.  The context here is that people are being attacked because people inexplicably falsely equivocate ""Chinese Virus"" to mean people of Chinese descent have it and carry into their neighborhoods.   I guarantee you if MERS were ravaging America right now we would also see a movement to refer to it by its scientific name EMC-2012 as well and instead of Asians, it would be Middle Easterns being vilified (again, or still). And I would be all for it instead of defending xenophobic rhetoric on reddit because it literally wouldn't hurt me to do so and maybe save a life or two in the process.  You have actual redditors in this very thread talking about how their lives are being affected by this type of rhetoric that emboldens racists. Posts like yours that deflect and miss the forest for the trees doesn't make things any better.  > not a reason to call somebody a racist  The past 3.5 years aside, the POTUS speaks on behalf of all Americans, does he not? If there is rhetoric that instigates violence against Americans, should he use it? Just because the word itself is just a synonym doesn't make it okay."	0

For what? Expecting others to be conscientious and not burden others, accidentally or otherwise? I fundamentally don't believe human beings should harm each other, and if you feel like you can't prevent harm while in society, you should remove yourself from it or be better. It's really not hard to go through life harming absolutely no one if you're careful and self aware. Rudy doesn't want to be careful and self aware, and seemingly r/nba doesn't either. I guess people here do shit they wouldn't want to be held responsible for a lot. Not me, personally. Can't imagine doing anything I wouldn't want to be held responsible for.	1

SBNation's also doing a Fumble Dimension for them too.

Nobody is saying they exploited all of their workers. To put it simply if anyone ever did an academic study into it, I'm certain they would find that there is a point where in order to make x amount of money (my guess is about $600 million fwiw maybe less) you must have exploited people along the way. Sure plenty of their office workers got paid, but there're the sweatshop workers, third world miners and people in factories with suicide nets whose work made their billions possible.	0

Hakeem gets shortchanged for things that were beyond his control. Wasn't his fault that Ralph Sampson broke down and it took the Rockets brass over a half decade to give him a decent supporting cast. He should've won at least 2 more titles.  And he doesn't get enough credit for being the best player on the court while beating the Showtime Lakers in the 86 Western Conference finals. A better scalp than Kobe ever got in his career.	0

You've fallen for MSM lies.  Here‚Äôs the real timeline of what happened (all of this BEFORE we had even one death in the US) :   1/6 CDC issues travel advisory for Wuhan.   1/11 CDC tweets about corona related ‚Äúpneumonia outbreak in China‚Äù   1/14 WHO tweets that there is no evidence of human to human transmission.   1/17 CDC started doing health screenings at 3 airports of travelers from China.   1/21 first case in US for someone who traveled directly from Wuhan.   1/23 WHO again says no human to human transmission outside of China.   1/27 WHO raises alert level but is still saying China has it contained.   1/28 CDC states ‚Äú While CDC considers covid a serious situation and is taking preparedness measures, the immediate risk in the US is considered low.‚Äù   1/29 White House announces Coronavirus Task Force created. Note - this is despite the WHO downplaying the threat!   1/31 Trump bans travel from China. Media and multiple Democrats slam his decision calling it racist/xenophobic. 2/5 Trump acquitted (impeachment).   2/5 Chuck Schumer in a tweet continues to call Trumps‚Äô travel ban from China ‚Äúpremature.‚Äù   2/7 White House‚Äôs Coronavirus Task Force gives press briefing.   2/9 White House Coronavirus Task Force meets with all governors regarding virus.   2/12 CDC waiting for approval from Chinese for CDC team to travel to China.   2/18 HHS announces partnership to develop vaccine.   2/21 Italy identifies its very first case in their country.   2/21 CDC tweets that it is working with States for preparedness.   2/24 Trump sent letter to Congress asking for $25B for virus effort.   2/24 Nancy Pelosi made a stop in Chinatown and encouraged people to ‚Äúplease come and visit and enjoy Chinatown.‚Äù   2/25 there is still no reported community spread in the US!!! (Per CDC tweet.)   2/27 first community transmission in US.   2/27 Trump appoints Pence to coordinate efforts.   2/29 FIRST reported Covid19 death in US.   It is helpful to look at the actual timeline. All of this happened BEFORE the 1st death in US.	0

Whats all these sucking lebrons nuts.. Lebron assembled his team..he is supposed to be the chosen one and went up against an inexperienced warriors team that didnt believe they could win in 2015. Warriors were test running their team in 2015 with the hope of making a championship run in 2016.in 2015 finals game 1 that kyrie played , cavs lost. Cavs went on to win games 2 and 3 without kyrie and lebron fuelling the fact that dellevadova was the reason curry missed shots and was mocking him.. now curry lit them up in games 4,5 and 6 then he started shouting he didnt have help..Kd only copied what lebron did by going to the warriors.. micheal beat everybody in his path..

Isaiah Stewart I love, think he‚Äôs the type to have a 15 year career. High energy, does the little things, throws his body around (and others‚Äô) but plays with a great feel and has some decent skill. I‚Äôm surprised he‚Äôs fallen so low on mocks these days, you‚Äôd think his biggest worry is that he‚Äôs too short to play the 5 but the league is downsizing these days.  McDaniels tho I‚Äôm not a fan of and I usually love the tall skinny wings. I just don‚Äôt think he plays smart basketball at all, and it negates what skill he does he have. To play the type of way he perceives himself, he either has to get a lot more skilled or a lot smarter and I don‚Äôt think either happens. He can be a more than solid stretch 4 but it‚Äôll take some self-reflection or else he‚Äôll just bounce around a bunch of teams on the bench	0

Isaac Okoro, though a lot of ppl have started to catch on. First and foremost he‚Äôs a winner (tough, competitive, fills multiple roles), great defender, underrated passer, plays to his strengths and rarely makes mistakes. Even if he doesn‚Äôt end up being a star he‚Äôs gonna be a plus role player even if he‚Äôs just putting up mediocre numbers. He‚Äôd be the bench player that plays 25mpg and ends up closing games for you  Jalen Smith, lean and mobile 6‚Äô10  3 and D big that can also rebound. Really fits today‚Äôs game. Honestly don‚Äôt know why he‚Äôs so low, might be because this is his second year? Don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs wrong with him besides maybe lacking star upside.  Amar Sylla, basically an ahead of schedule Pascal Siakam. Plays for Real Madrid too so you know he‚Äôs learning the game the right way. Has to clean up his skill level and put on good weight, but I think his versatility is really gonna help get him on the floor	1

Yes.  Inbound pass and dude shoots the 3 from full court literally every time.

"> You just can't read between the lines if you think Brown's response is anything but a standard diplomatic response about a former teammate.  Brown has no reason to come to his defence. If he really had a problem with him he could have just as easily said absolutely nothing at all.  It isn‚Äôt just Brown either. Smart has said the same. You‚Äôre telling me all of these players are lying, and you‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs telling the truth?Come on now.  > Why do you refuse to acknowledge that Brown and Tatum took a step forward this year because Kyrie is gone? It's fairly clear that you refuse to acknowledge any narrative that involves Kyrie taking any blame for the Celtics last season.  That isn‚Äôt ‚Äúclear‚Äù whatsoever.  Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are 3rd overall picks in their 3rd and 4th seasons respectively. This is exactly when they‚Äôre *supposed* to be taking a leap into star players. Their play this season is literally a natural, year to year progression that elite young prospects are supposed to go through. It isn‚Äôt anywhere near as simple as ‚ÄúKyrie‚Äôs gone so they‚Äôre better‚Äù. Their play this season is the result of several seasons work in the league and the game finally slowing down for them.  > Me calling you an idiot is not ""taking this personally"" the same way I can call flat earthers idiots casually and not be emotionally invested.  Throwing personal insults because somebody disagrees with you about a basketball player is absolutely taking it personally. Especially when that person comes with facts. You‚Äôre just upset you lost an argument.  > You are the one who seems personally invested in this Kyrie adoration, not me  In what way? I have no reason to adore Kyrie. I‚Äôm just not small minded enough to let r/nba narratives affect my opinion of a player.  Let me put it simply. There isn‚Äôt a single front office in the league that would trade Kyrie for DLo should they have the chance. Not a single one. If you believe any of them would then your player evaluation skills are severely lacking."	0

"He's portraying a situation in which the homophobia affecting the NBA disproportionately originates from POCs. This may or may not be true.  I'm pointing out that many white people are also homophobic, and I'm asserting that religion is the most common thread for homophobes, not ""un-whiteness"".   I don't necessarily see the value of, for example, lumping Chinese Buddhist fans in with Catholic Latino fans as ""the POC population"" while ignoring evangelical whites who, believe it or not, *do* watch the NBA.  I just don't think the way he dissected it is necessarily the most reasonable way to do so."	1

I‚Äôm not referring specifically to who you are replying to but as a general point, Lol someone like Becky Hammond knows more about the nba locker room and culture than fans do.   If she thinks it‚Äôs too sexist an environment that the team wouldn‚Äôt be rrady for a head coach and hence she doesn‚Äôt want the position her coming to that decision is understandable. But that doesn‚Äôt appear to be what‚Äôs happening and yet many still insist ‚Äúit‚Äôs unfair to her to even consider her a candidate and let her subject herself to misogyny!!‚Äù. As if misogyny is going away anytime soon and that the people actually facing it shouldn‚Äôt be the ones who decide whether a situation poses too much of it that‚Äôs it‚Äôs not worth dealing with for them	1

Duncan robinson is not a rookie. He is a 2nd year player who shot 28% 3pt in his rookie year. Shot 44% from 3pt this year and is averaging 13ppg. Curry averaged 19ppg in his 2nd year and shot 44% so stop hating and appreciate greatness.. it gets a lot harder once u are an established shooter. Im sure duncan robinson may not shoot 30% if he gets to take the kind of shots curry takes. Even iguodala said he can never teach his kid to shoot like curry because its more of a gift than something u can learn. He just has amazing hand eye coordination. Plays pingpong very well, golfs very well. Could play pro golf if he wanted to. Bowls amazingly , throws perfect darts. Im not disputing that someone will one day break his records but he is an amazing talent and your hatred is second to none. Please drop Hakeem's name from your moniker. He is nothing like u are.

The answer is no, a 23-yr old, 3rd year Ceballos was not going to tilt the series vs the eventual three-peat Bulls.  While Ceballos would blossom into a go-to player for the Lakers, and was on a solid run of 18-8 prior to getting hurt, he was not yet that All-star in Phoenix, similar to McGrady in Toronto or Harden in Oklahoma. Simply transposing later success onto an earlier rendition is asinine as Ceballos was not a made man, and had yet to break out. By all accounts Dumas was every bit the starting SF, putting up nearly 16ppg, 4.3 Reb 1.3stl 1.0blk per game, sandwiching a couple of 17pt games with a monster 20pt 12reb 5ast 2stl 3blk gm-1, and 25-5 in gm-5. Point is, he eclipsed whatever perceived production you think Ceballos would have given the Suns. Jordan still put up 41ppg for the single greatest finals output in history, Charles still struggled in games 1, 3, 5 and 6 and the Bulls still showed why being the defending Champs matters.	0

Picking durant at shooting is dumb. You have to take Curry, he is by far the best shooter ever.  Durant shot 45 from the field and 32% from three in the post season before he joined a 73 win team that made back to back finals and won a title without him.  Their last 3 postseasons without being on the same team  Durant (16,14,13) - 49% EFG% and 57% TS   Curry - (16,15,14) - 56% EFG and 60% TS   Last 3 regular seasons without each other curry still out shot him   Durant - (16,14,13) - 57% EFG% and 64% TS  Curry (16,14,14) 60% EFG% and 64% TS	0

Yes I still play baskerball and I know its not the smartest thing to do, but I have taken other protective measures and drastically decreased the amount of people I come into contact on a daily basis. Of the very few people I do now interact with, all are informed that I play basketball and it is their fault and responsibility for putting themselves at risk.  No I never stated that me playing basketball will help flatten the curve.  Yes, the amount of *active* cases will be higher if we didn't quarentine, but about the same total amount of people will end up having gotten infected.  Pull up any flatten the curve graph and they will all show you that more quarentine and social distancing will only increase the total duration of this pandemic which was my whole point in the first place.	0

Every QB in the league plays with the air pressure in the footballs because the league let teams supply their own. Brady‚Äôs were probably right at the lower boundary at the start of the game but the cold temps dropped the pressure below the limit. A bunch of educators have used this to teach the relevant chemistry/physics. Check out the last couple pages [here](http://chemistrye.weebly.com/uploads/3/7/7/0/37707825/gas_laws_case_study.pdf).  The fact that the league lets each team supply its own balls for the game, never recorded pressures prior to the game, and had never checked them during the game prior to that particular game, should probably tell you how much the league cared about the air pressure before this.    A ball that is fully inflated in the locker room (to the maximum PSI of 13.5) would still be under the minimum legal pressure if the game was played at a temp roughly 20 degrees colder than the room they were stored in before the initial measurement. Considering the sport is played in the fall and winter, that‚Äôs probably a large chunk of games.   That said, even if they were under inflating the balls, there‚Äôs zero evidence this actually means anything to the ability to throw or catch it. No one has actually tested in any meaningful way the effect of the relative inflation level of a football on how easy it is to throw or catch. The NFL‚Äôs rules appear to be based solely on the manufacturer‚Äôs recommendations.   What the falcons were doing almost certainly had more of an impact on the results of games. There wasn‚Äôt a 35 million dollar fishing expedition in to that one, tho, or a couple hundred pages of reports that scientists mostly scoffed at.	0

"i agree with everything you said, but mostly regarding the fact there are countless reasons to criticize the President and honestly the entire ruling class worldwide which bungled this all.

They re-organized under Bolton the pandemic response team.   That is a valid criticism and I would like to know why and how that effected our response.

Culturally, 2007 was a long time ago. And even young adults (18-27 or so) can hold some pretty immature, dumb thoughts that get straightened out by life experience.

None of those jokes would fly now. In Frienda, Ross‚Äôs wimpiness is built on the fact that he wasn‚Äôt man enough to prevent his wife from turning lesbian.	0
If you raise minimum wage, you raise the wages of all other workers currently making more than minimum wage, and it doesn nothing but harm people. This money isn't coming out of thin air, and it isn't coming out of businesses pockets, either. They will raise prices to compensate. Every single time.   Minimum wage is literally a scam that hurts everyone EXCEPT people who are unwilling to improve themselves and politicians who get in votes based off of those policies.   Fuck the minimum wage. Fuck it so hard.  Literally creates unemployment.  Edit: Everyone thinks that raising the minimum wage takes money out of the pockets of evil billionaires. Go look at the average Amazon hourly wage for a warehouse worker. Seriously. Look that shit up.   You are DESTROYING small businesses. Especially ones that operate on thin margins, like the restaurant industry.  Y'all need to educate yourself on this. It's a necessity. We have got to stop voting for minimum wage increases.

Curry without even blinking. People look at cp3's assists and say he is a better facilitator but i believe curry is a better facilitator who doesnt care about personal stats. Warriors offense run by curry generates the highest number of assists. If u count curry's hockey assists u will realise his playmaking skills is beyond what the score sheet reflects. A PG should be able to make his team mates better and curry has done exactly that.. if draymond was playing with CP3 would he ever be an all star?. Why is it that almost all cp3's ex team mates hate him. I heard stories that he passes the ball to teammates with the shot clock winding down to avoid taking the turnover..Curry has no issue with team mates and coaches which is even as important in winning as on court plays.. more efficient scorer, great facilitator, great team mate..

Sorry but you should inform yourself on the situation. I'm a Nursing student, all you said was just plain wrong. More exposure means more cases, this virus spreads quite easily and it takes 2 weeks to for it to act, so there will be infected people that without knowing will be infecting others. Plus, the more cases in the Hospital, the worse it gets in there and it doesn't mean outside the Hospital the situation is better, because it likely isn't. The bigger the strain on the Hospitals, the likelier it is that health care providers will become infected and will have to be treated or quarantined themselves, putting an even bigger strain on the Hospital.  Just stay home when you can. You don't know who's infected and if you're already infected, so don't go out infecting others.	0

This is ridiculous.   Kevin Garnett would talk about your wife, parents getting cancer, people dying.   Kobe Bryant called a ref a fag on national television, cheated on his wife and settled a sexual assault case. He made it up to her with a an 8 million dollar diamond ring.  There are other players that literally tried to kill their coach (Sprewell) that don't get as much shit as D Wade does. Dude has some bad on-court moments but what he has done for representation of fathers, black fathers, gay, trans, and all he has done for Chicago, Miami, and some specific people should far outweigh that.	0

Of course, when we made the decision, we felt that while Game Threads are very much the same game to game (title straight forward, body straight forward, posted an hour before tip). Post Game Threads are where the community can be involved and add a little flavor. The other benefit, is the most reliable way for a bot to know when a game is done is through the NBA API, which for timing purposes is not always consistent, and results in a delay in posting, which human posters do not have that issue. This is one of the reasons why we have mods post the Post Game Threads during the playoffs, when a place to have instant reactions are in high demand. So basically we felt there were enough benefits to leaving PGTs as is to warrant leaving them alone. Obviously this is an issue, that is possible, and while we've encountered before, it was pretty limited in occurrences, so if we can maintain that, that would be ideal.	1

You're 100% right on the point of there being a big gap between the LGB and the T lol, it's something that gets discussed a lot within the lgbt community as well. In the loosest possible sense, transitioning simply means undergoing changes to better accommodate your gender identity rather than the identity you were assigned at birth - whether this takes the form of something as simple as a different name and pronouns or something as complicated as sex reassignment surgery and HRT.   Your original comment was fine, if i'm honest i took more of an issue with your second reply, which came across a bit more victim complex-y. The majority of the time if lgbt people say that you've done or said something bigoted towards lgbt individuals or the community, they probably aren't just saying it for fun. Now I can clearly tell you're pretty open minded and reasonable given that you're engaging in this discussion in good faith, so just listening to why they say that or accepting that you might have done something offensive and trying to change for the next time is the best way to deal with that situation. Sometimes it's as simple as just 'we live this, we know about our circumstances better, so please don't speak over us on the topic' you know?	1

Just read your own statement and see who is being racist lol. Fucking hypocritical idiot.  Edit: I know I will get downvoted and that‚Äôs fine, but how the fuck is saying white people this and white people that not a racist generalization? I know all about privilege and all of that, but it‚Äôs okay to group all white people into the same category (always talking negatively about them). Seems like generalizations of an entire race and how they think are the very things spoken up against by the very people doing the same thing in relation to white people. How the fuck do you not see that? It can‚Äôt be not okay to do to some, but okay to do to others. It‚Äôs the very concept that people are talking about on this thread when it comes to people not taking Asian racism serious enough. People suck and always have to blame and hate on some race or generation I guess.	0

This isnt true at all. On any level.  Lin wasn't traded. He got injured that year. He was a restricted RFA and the Rockets offered such a huge contract that the Knicks didn't want to match. At the time of his signing, the third year was $15 million. That was more than all but like the top 20 players in the league was making. Lebron and Chris Paul were making $16 million that year. Lin wasn't that good and there were concerns he wasn't going to be the same when he recovered.   As for the Melo vs Lin thing... The media completely manufactured it as far as anyone call tell.

"I tried to explain that to them but they seemed to just nod their heads and then change the subject. It's annoying that they're dismissive, I don't know if they realize that roughly half my male friends are gay. it definitely hurt to hear them say that, but to me it sounded like it was from a place of ignorance not hatred if that makes sense. They specifically called it ""weird"" and weren't as intense as banning it from discussion. I genuinely think they just don't understand it because all they understand is heterosexual relationships. They were also an arranged marriage which reinforces this idea. Being gay in Indian culture just barely started to be socially acceptable and it's all due to western television and entertainment. It'll change with our generation, it already has."	1

Can get better for sure. I just don't think that bumps the Celtics up a tier.

These things are compatible   100% agreed that Asian people have faced tons of racism in the US as well. The Chinese Exclusion Act is one of the best examples, where the full weight of the government was placed behind a racist policy. Or the internment camps during world war II   Also agreed that things are more difficult to parse out between some Asian countries. Still, there are lasting scars from things like the Rape of Nanking and Japanese occupation of South Korea that give an extra heft to discrimination between those groups.    I'm not an expert and don't claim to be - still, it seems clear to me that historical injustices and current power dynamics are the key differences between discrimination and racism.	0

Reddit being openly racist to Asians is nothing new. I've dealt with this shit since I was a little kid. Most of the people on Reddit will never have to experience racism firsthand and thus have no empathy. It's honestly the harsh reality of this entire situation.

In the 60s there were 8 teams so Wilt and Russel had to go up against a Hall of Famer almost every night. Many of the guys playing back then were legends, and its mighty disrespectful to say they weren't. Also I don't care what era youre in, Bill Russell has a ring for every single finger, and his dick for christs sake! Wilt averaged 50 for an entire season. Wilt averaged 39 ppg thru 7 seasons. Thats fucking batshit. Russell is 21-0 in elimination games. Without him, on two seperate occasions his teams went on losing streaks when he was injured, so you cant say he just had a good team. Listen, I dont mean to insult you, but perhaps you should go watch some of their actual games before spouting out nonsense youve been hearing in the echo chamber that we call reddit.

People here seem to have totally forgotten about the incident but little do they know China's CCTV has broadcasted zero NBA games this season and their online broadcaster Tencent has also stopped broadcasting games starting Jan 1, 2020. Now the only way to watch NBA in China is via illegal streams.  On a side note, the biggest basketball online forum in China literally removed their sub forum for Houston Rockets and they are pretending that NBA only has 29 teams. During their all star prediction Harden was completely ignored as if he got kidnapped by aliens and never existed on the planet it is actually comical.   Edit: I have been told by other redditors that Tencent has resumed broadcasting the games, except for the rockets games of course. They are sent to the shadow realm. CCTV remains the same and is not broadcasting any NBA games.	1

I actually did answer his question just in another comment chain right below it. And just for the record you shouldn't brush off what are very clear signs of mental unease in your comments.  A living wage is one in which a person working 40 hours a week can afford all the necessities (shelter, clothing, a phone, health care, etc.) as well as have enough left over at the end of the month for an emergency fund (so that you can actually take a breath that isn't tainted by the pressure of wondering what happens if you miss just one paycheck and maybe not be terrified about your financial situation every waking second).   THAT is a living wage. It will be different depending on the state and even city, and not everyone will be diligent about saving, but what I outlined isn't outrageous or impossible.	1

"You think there's absolutely no reason for former teammates to dissipate contraversy with diplomatic responses? When did you start watching sports?   I never said dlo was better, I said they were comparable. As in they're both inferior guards who will never contend for championships as the main piece. At the end of the day I'm sure the Celtics would have rather had dlo than Kyrie Irving, the Celtics would rather have an inferior kemba walker than Kyrie too.  Where are your ""facts""? You provided anecdotes and opinions and absolutely no facts.  And no, me calling you an idiot is not me being personally invested. I'm just calling you an idiot. Get over it.  Again, if you don't think Kyrie caused locker room issues with the Celtics last year (issues in Brooklyn and Cleveland too), I dunno what to tell you. You are socially under developed."	0

For the final time, the point he is *specifically* making in this widely reported instance, one where he shines a spotlight on implicit racial biases, is a good one. I take that 100/100 times over someone just saying ""well that guy's a bigot unlike the rest of us *normal people*!"" That would be incredibly naive and unhelpful, because it's simply not true.

Here is a question for you? Have you followed what any other countries are doing?  Because Canada is offering people $2000 a month, plus Canadians have health care and aren‚Äôt reliant on insurance.  Canada also has it so you can‚Äôt travel across provinces too, and stay at home orders in every location.   The growth of covid in the states is increasing faster than any other country and has been for about 2 weeks. It isn‚Äôt going to slow down either.  It is hilarious how ignorant you are if you think that the trump administration has been doing a good job preparing for this. You need to compare your country vs other countries, not what Trump has done vs other presidents who have never faced an epidemic. I‚Äôm glad you enjoy my username, it represents people like you!	0

"NHL does have a higher level of acceptance based on polls and imo public player support for LGBT issues.  I think hockey its for different reasons, there seems to be a higher level of acceptance at the pro level but in the minors its way more toxic and overbearing.   Teams matter way more in the NHL (nature of the sport) and anything that's a distraction is bad.  NHL hates celebrations, wants generic answers, focuses on the team, ect.  Its more about not being a ""selfish distraction"".     Big factor I've heard personally is just the insane amount of attention (positive and negative) that you would feel should have nothing to do with your professional life.  Should be a minor thing but the first gay athletes are going to go through media hell on top of general homophobia in the sports, sponsorship issues, not being treated the same, ect."	1

"Assuming you're referring to elected officials and not voters, I completely agree with the first and last sentences, but not the middle one.

1. The Warrior were better the season before Durant than they were with Durant.  2. Curry is more unguardable than Durant (if it were the other way around, Durant would be the one with 2 MVPs) 3. Steph was dropping 30 a game in 34 minutes; KD needed 38+ 4. Steph let KD have more shots because he is a team player with no ego and knew KD's fragile ego needed to feel like he was the man.   I mean, when KD won the Finals MVP, all he could do was go off about how hard it is to set yourself apart from other players on a great team rather than give his teammates credit for opening things up for him.   I feel like Richard Jefferson has some blind spot here, because he is normally a smart dude, but this comment just seems to be way out there.	0

Honestly I think it would be fairly easy, as long as your above 6ft. The reality is the assists would come pretty quick as I think I'm a pretty good passer with decent handles(I obvi would get killed by an nba or even college defender, but think I could at least get 10 assists over 82 games in a half court setting)  and 5 rebounds across the season would come just based on lucky bounces. 20 points would be difficult depending on playing time, however most nba players would probably just give you tons of space and guard the actual other NBA players on the court lol.	0

Sure I‚Äôll explain. I think the first thing is that bin laden intentionally killed those people through action and trump on the other hand caused more deaths through inaction.

I think there‚Äôs a big difference between intentional murder and inaction due to ignorance. Almost every president at some point makes decisions that cost lives. I don‚Äôt think this means they can be equated to murderers. And I don‚Äôt think this means they deserve death..... but just to be clear I really dislike trump and this he‚Äôs an idiot and a terrible leader. Just don‚Äôt want him to die because of it.	0

"okay, so not really any love for brokers from me . . .  . . . but y'all are morons if you think ticketmaster, promoters and  artists ""hate"" scalpers.  They literally create them.  Intentionally.  Because it means they can set simple price points and sell out stadiums AND make more money.  The alternative is much riskier.  Put another way: you COULD (if you do it JUST RIGHT) make just as much  money on ticket sales with a 1/2 full arena and a ""properly"" priced  market.  But then they would all die on merch and concessions, AND have a  pissed off artist and promoter who looks like they can't draw the  venues they book.  But instead, until 2018 ticketmaster OWNED ITS OWN RESELLER MARKETPLACES.  GET IT?  The reseller market is a DEMAND CUSHION created BY AND FOR the ticketing agencies and the promoters and venues they work for.  If they wanted it to go away, they would price differently.  Instead, they  throw that entire margin to the brokers because its not worth the risk  of not selling as many $15 Bud Lights.  These people aren't stupid.  Ticket scalpers are not that far from independent, un-contracted employees.  They perform a service for the ticketing  agencies/teams/venues/artists/promoters.  I'm sorry to be the one  informing you of this.  It's the  billionaire-who's-sports-team-you-worship's fault.  Fucking duh.  tldr: blame ticketmaster you hapless fuckwits.

"Tf you mean ""Lmao did you really just ask that?"" You implied that Jordan leaving the Bulls equated to them going from 57 wins to 55 the year without him. It's flat out wrong. Critical thinking my fucking ass.   > transparently chasing rings  Are you just dense then? If you want to talk so much about Jordan's team changing after him leaving (which isn't what you fucking meant at all you fucking mong), let's look at the differences between Miami the year before that ""gOt BoUNceD oUt oF ThE FiRSt rOuNd"". Added: Mike Bibby, **CHRIS FUCKING BOSH**, Eddie House, Ilgauskas, and Mike Miller. The idea that Miami wasn't a stacked deck unlike joining the Celtics or Spurs is such horseshit.  > And when he left Miami, he chose the cavs  Jeez, I wonder if it had anything to do with the immense amount of draft capital they had and immediately turned into Kevin Love? I seem to remember in his Letter to Cleveland or whatever there was no mention of either Anthony Bennett or Andrew Wiggins and I wonder why? Maybe because they were getting shipped out on the next flight leaving Cleveland Hopkins airport.  >And then the same thing when he joined the lakers  And there was a huge amount of fanfare for him saying ""they were going to be patient, this was a learning process, they won't be instant contenders"", just for him to be passive-aggressive in the media and for Anthony Davis to sewer another franchise to try and force his way to LA. **And still** within 365 days of him being in LA, him and Klutch strong-armed a franchise into getting him a unanimous top 10 player/probable top 5 player in the league.  Cite David Griffin all you want, he holds no water for me. For all the talk about what a great GM he is, he hasn't drafted shit in New Orleans besides Zion (a gimme), and had his job saved by LeBron after he was at the helm when they drafted Anthony Bennett and Andrew Wiggins. For every story from David Griffin about LeBron not meddling, there's one from Pat motherfucking Riley about how **a month into his first season with the Heat** he asked Riley if he would fire Spoelstra and take over the team.  Who do you think has more cachet in the NBA? A GM who has done nothing noteworthy in his career besides cater to LeBron for the 3 years they were together, or **PAT. FUCKING. RILEY**?"	1

"Oh my god, this is getting embarassing for you.  > He literally used Stockton and Curry as the examples and gave examples of how different models would effect the outcomes, and it works perfect opposite of how you think it does. The literal calculation has Stockton far and away better and its only after applying the statistical model that gives greater weight to higher achieving individual seasons that Curry jumps up the rankings.  You do realize that this is with a new model that weights longevity even more heavily at it's base right (even before the corrections to the curve)...   You do realize that the guy who made these models himself does not use that one for his top 40 list, precisely because it's even less accurate than the original model right...  Why do you think Curry is ranked higher than Stockton in his top 40, that was updated in 2019, despite him exploring this new (innacurate) model in 2018? C'mon kid, use your head for once.  > In other words, exactly what I said at the start of the conversation and exactly opposite of what you claimed it did.  Except it's not. You're confusing the experimental model's data with the original model's (which is what I made used to back up my claims), you fucking buffoon.  How do you get so confused so often? That's been a consistent theme for you in this thread. Looooooooooooooooool.  > still have yet to read the article.  You do see the irony in this right?  > We both know you didn't actually read that shit  Funny, since you clearly didn't read my comments.  What's defensible about:   > West still had the ball in his hands more than Goodrich, especially during the prime of West's career when he played like 40 minutes a game. Goodrich didn't handle the ball as much as West until the 70 season when he returned to the Lakers  You still don't understand that having the ball in your hands doesn't make you a point guard.   Maybe that's why you turned tail and ran away from this:  *More ignorance. Being a score first guard doesn't preclude you from being a point guard, and handling the ball more/averaging more assists than a PG doesn't imply that you're a PG.*  *LeBron handles the ball (and averages more assists) than many point guards. Larry Bird did too. They were both better pure passers than the majoirty of PGs, and yet they are considered small forwards. Harden and Jokic handle the ball a ton and also average more assists than most PGs. Should we consider them PGs instead of SG and C then? Of course not.*  *For more than half of West's career, he played alongside Gail Goodrich. They were both combo guards and could play both positions, so that's where the confusion comes from. Some people say West was the PG and Goodrich was the SG, but most (in my experience) have West as the SG. There's a reason you see Jerry West on all-time SG rankings more often than you do on PG rankings.*  *For example, ESPN has him on their all-time [SG rankings](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/nbarankSGs/ranking-top-10-shooting-guards-ever), and not on their all-time [PG rankings](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/nbarankPGs/ranking-top-10-point-guards-ever)*  You thought being a score first player has anything to do with whether you are a point guard or not. Wrong.  You thought if a player averages more assists than a point guard then he must also be a point guard. Wrong.  You keep zero-ing on whether West was an SG or PG, which is irrelevant to this discussion as Curry had both a better peak and better resume. And I've already said that it's subjective but that way more people have him as an SG for a reason.  On this sub, and on /r/ nbadiscussion ([example here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cj5gtp/who_are_your_top_5_shooting_guards_of_alltime/)), way more people consider him to be an SG than a PG. ESPN didn't have him on the PG list, neither did Bleacher Report. But again, it's irrelevant in regards to whether Stockton is better than Curry, or in regards to whether Curry had a higher peak and better resume.  > You also said Curry was better than West regardless of position, which is actually insane.  No, it's really not. I said he had a better peak and resume, and since I value those highly I would have him over West. And clearly many people agree.   *Turns out Bleacher Report's [rankings from 2019](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2852716-nba-all-time-player-rankings-top-10-point-guards#slide9) also don't consider West a PG. They also have Curry above Stockton, and at #2 overall.*  *In fact, the majority of rankings I've found online that were made recently (after Curry's MVPs and championships and numerous elite seasons) have Curry above Stockton. Quite a few have him in the #2 spot as well.*  *This writer for [nba.com](https://www.nba.com/magic/news/ranking-point-guards-history-3-20180126) does have West as a PG, which is a point for you, but they also have Curry in the #2 spot (easily above Stockton).*  *I checked out what the folks over at /r/ nbadiscussion think, and the [majority over there](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ax2s4w/steph_currys_all_time_point_guard_ranking/) seem to have Curry as the #2 PG of all-time as well.*  And let's not forget how you just straight up lied to inflate Stockton's impact:  *This is wrong. First of all, Magic literally had a better assist per game rate over his career. And even if you were talking about best assist per game rate over a single season, then that's still a ""dishonest stat"" as there are multiple players who would have had better assist per game rates than Stockton if they were on those Jazz teams. Stockton is practically the only PG to play his entire starting career alongside one of the best ten scorers in NBA history.*  *And if your comment was referring to best per game rates in a single season, then when it comes to defensive stats you would be even more wrong. There have been multiple players who have exceeded Stockton's career high in defensive stats in a single season (and multiple players who have better per game defensive stats for their career).*  *So whether you meant that no player has matched Stockton's per game assist and defensive stat rates in his peak seasons or over his career, that's a straight up lie. For both steals and assists there are players who have exceeded Stockton's career per game rates, and quite a few players who have exceeded his season-high defensive stat rates. There is so much wrong in your comment I have to wonder if you're on drugs today.*  #Just a pathetic lack of reading comprehension and basketball knowledge lmao."	0

[Because the Trump administration failed us. ](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/06/coronavirus-testing-failure-123166)   Edit: Apologies. This link appears to be outdated info. Per the comment below from u/terp_on_reddit, I did some quick research and he appears to be correct.   The Trump administration still failed us, though.   [The administration has implied the WHO test isn‚Äôt accurate enough,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/health/coronavirus-tests-who.html) which is not correct.   [Here‚Äôs a more recent article from ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-south-korea-scaled-coronavirus-testing-while-the-us-fell-dangerously-behind) contrasting the difference between America‚Äôs and South Korea‚Äôs responses:   The contrast to the United States, which tested a few thousand people in the weeks when health experts say the outbreak was spreading across this country, could not be more stark. Instead of using the template approved by the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention set out to create its own test from scratch, only to see that effort plagued by delay and dysfunction that continues to this day.  America‚Äôs inability to know who is infected has broad implications. It means that infected people have wandered through offices, buses, restaurants, emergency rooms and malls, indiscriminately spreading the virus.  Edit 2: One more addition since this is getting views.   Never forget that it never had to be as bad as it‚Äôs going to get.    Washington Post editorial: [I ran the White House pandemic office. Trump closed it. ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/nsc-pandemic-office-trump-closed/2020/03/13/a70de09c-6491-11ea-acca-80c22bbee96f_story.html)   ‚ÄúWhen President Trump took office in 2017, the White House‚Äôs National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense survived the transition intact. Its mission was the same as when I was asked to lead the office, established after the Ebola epidemic of 2014: to do everything possible within the vast powers and resources of the U.S. government to prepare for the next disease outbreak and prevent it from becoming an epidemic or pandemic.   One year later, I was mystified when the White House dissolved the office, leaving the country less prepared for pandemics like covid-19.‚Äù	1

John Wall WILL be fine and WILL still be an all-star caliber player when he returns especially with all the medical advances today. A lot of people seem to forget that these are ELITE ATHLETES/ ALPHA MALES physically. They are not your normal human beings. The achilles he tore was on was not on the leg he jumps from plus looking at his workouts he still looks pretty damn fast.   John Wall himself says that this is the most healthiest that he's been since his rookie year or something like that. Which is reasonably because he's been carrying the team for a long time but now that Beal is a top SG in the nba he doesn't have to carry a lot.  If this was the 90s or 2000s when the league was at it's most physical, then yea I would be a little concerned but in TODAY'S nba where teams allow dudes to walk in the lane and defense is sooooo weak, I'm not worried about Wall one bit. I predict that he'll average around 18 pts, 10 asts, 6 rebs, 1.5 stls, 0.9 blks next season.  To your Derrick Rose point. Rose has said himself that he holds back and doesn't play as hard as he used to due to his prior injuries because he is thinking about life after basketball and being able to do things with his son etc. The man still has hops.	0

I was going to respond to one of your comments in another thread last night about educating yourself before speaking as if fact, but I refrained from doing so. Now I know for damn sure you're just talking out of your ass.  There is an NBA-specific study out there if you actually look. Most players are at full efficiency 1 year after the surgery. The biggest con is the small chance of re-injury, but there have been plenty that have not.   FYI... some guy named Scottie Pippen had the same surgery to start his NBA career. He turned out alright, I think.	1

The record and the championships don't say much. UCLA had won two consecutive championships before Kareem and then went on to win four straight the second he left. They were a ridiculously dominant team regardless of him and won multiple championships and rarely lost games without him.  Kareem is in the conversation, but to act like he is undeniably the GOAT is plain absurd... Go look at what Bird did in his three years at Indiana fucking State and you will understand why. Bill Walton also has a legitimate claim as the college basketball GOAT and so has Oscar Robertson.  So yeah, saying that calling anyone besides Kareem the GOAT is ridiculous actually is absolutely retarded.	0

This is complete nonsense because the cdc isn‚Äôt lagging one week behind. The simple fact of the matter is that if you looked at any of the stats on coronavirus testing in the USA practically nobody was getting tested despite showing symptoms for the longest time.   Sk was testing even mild symptoms from the beginning and was tracking every single infected and doing targeted testing.   The USA has limited its testing to only those who are seriously ill and have known contact to a previously infected person. But if they haven‚Äôt been testing for infected people, then this dumbass attempt at testing based on known personal connections to a sick person has basically crippled any testing results the USA had in the past. Even if they catch up with testing 50k a day from today onwards it‚Äôs likely due to the exponential growth nature of the virus that the USA will be significant worse off than skorea and given the fact that Americans of younger ages have more comorbidities due to obesity related health issues, the USA is going to be much much worse off.  Italy is going to be a pisstake compared to the USA when the stats finally catch up after 2 weeks of 50k plus testing and overburdened hospitals.	0

"I think you're kinda re-writing history.  Out of all the guys you mentioned in the east, ""Jason Kidd, Vince Carter, Antwan Jamison, Caron Butler, Chris Weber, Rasheed Wallace,  Richard Jefferson"" only one of them (Chauncey Billups) made all NBA (3rd team).  The East sucked that year.  The number 1 seeded Pistons were old and only won 53 games.  The top 3 seeds in the West won more games than that.  The fearsome Nets you're talking about finished 41-41.  They were a 6 seed and barely 500.  The Spurs barely escaped a 7 game series with the Suns after some controversial suspensions and then swept the Cavs in a series where it never really felt like the Cavs had a chance.  The East was absolutely weak compared to the West that year.  Lebron was amazing, but the argument that he had a tough road to the finals that year is bullshit."	0

Regardless of what you think of his policies, it is a fact that his ideals haven't changed since he came into politics and he has tirelessly fought for things that seem normal now (black rights, gay rights etc) that were controversial, to say the least, when he was fighting for them.

Another myth I hate is that Magic played center in 1980. He did not, he did the jumpball, he was not playing center after that. The next is pippen guarding magic and shutting him down. Magic did better against pippen than any other bulls defender, and MJ guarded Magic more than pippen did. I love killing bonehead myths.	0

I didn't play, but I'm from southern Indiana and my local high school played Washington in sectionals one year, which is the school all of the Zeller brothers came through. Cody was there at this point, and he had a really quiet first half, just grabbed a bunch of boards and had maybe 10 points. We were up going into halftime, not by much, but we were up. I think Cody had like 25 points in the second half, nobody could do anything to stop him, grabbed every rebound, pretty much everything he put up dropped. Tom Crean was there scouting and everyone knew it was for Cody, I'm pretty sure it was his senior year	0

Well, we are constantly changing words and name because it has racist connotation. For example here in Sweden we had a pastry that was called n****boll, but around 90's, the n-word started to have a racist connotation here because of the similarity between it and the English word(mostly because of American movies and TV show). So now its called chokladboll.   So, if it really is so racist as some claim, its not pointless to change the name of the Spanish flu..	0

Many people complain about how much these lockdowns are hurting many people and I aree. We can't expect to lockdown America for so long, but we need to get people hve already and can be affected by this and it's not good. It's why I wish people just stopped panicking like the babies in r/coronovirus making everything seemed like the end of the world and people at /unpopularopinion saying this virus is a joke and that everything should cater ot people who won't bve affected and going to malllies and getting dollies for my baby girl is more important. Hey consevrtive go FUCK YOURSELF. I don't care if KAT is a celebrity, his mother fuckin died and seemed like a average American. Fuck America at times.

Dude as a warriors fan, if u removed curry from that series, they don't win one game. How come warriors lost games 2 and 3 in which curry struggled. Even iggy knows he didnt deserve that FMVP over curry. Curry carried double teams all through that series and averaged 26 ppg. Iggy never shot a contested shot all series long and averaged 16ppg.. If Cavs never double teamed curry, he would average like 35ppg and iggy won't average more than 10ppg. Why didn't Ben Wallace win FMVP when pistons won if FMVP is based on playing defense..Tell me they wouldn't have given it to curry if he was a Nike athlete.	0

>if we go by just the percentages  stopped reading here  just going by the 3pt% is stupid  42.6% of steph's 3pa last season were off the dribble  81.3% of trae's 3pa this season were off the dribble  68.9% of steph's 3pters last season were assisted  29.8% of trae's 3pters this season were assisted  the average distance of a trae 3pa this season? 27.36 feet  the average distance of a steph 3pa last season? 25.92 feet  im not sure how ANYBODY could watch trae and steph play and think it is appropriate to compare their 3pt percentages directly. it's utterly useless.   disclaimer: i think that steph curry is the best shooter in nba history. that is not up for debate. steph's pull-up 3pt% is higher than trae's, and his 3pt% off of passes is higher than trae's. but *far* too many people directly compare his 3pt% to players like james harden and trae young which makes the gap seem bigger than it is.	0

"This is what I don't get about this whining about the Raptors ""easy schedule"".  It isn't rocket science. There are more bad teams this year so of course there are more teams under 500. Look at everyone else during their last 15 games. Sure as shit they're going to be facing mostly teams under .500  With all these teams ""better than the Raptors"" also playing roughly the same amount of teams under .500 during this stretch, why don't all of them have the same kind of streak, if not more?  Also, what does it say going to the other side of this argument, that these superior teams are losing a lot more games to teams under .500? Must be a shitty team to keep losing to teams without a winning record.  This obsession with discrediting the Raptors streak right now is beyond pathetic. I find it even more funny considering the amount of injuries we have had. But go on, keep spreading this shit if that helps you feel comfortable about your team."	1

but you did remember something and extrapolated my entire comment type based on?   I don't even talk about curry much, you can't even deny you spend all day talking shit about bron.

Talking about pathetic when you do that. Talking about bronsexuals when you're a currysexual. Get what I mean? You're complaining about the very thing you are. Literally every insult you aim at bron fans get be applied to you with curry.   I like bron, but I wasn't cheering for him when he faced my team. I started watching ball a decade ago because of bron so that's why I'm a fan of his. But his success doesn't mean shit for my city. People like you don't understand that.

Michael Jordan did it 4 times, arguably should have been 5 x in 1997 (when he had superior stats to Malone and much better record).

"Names themselves are never racist, sexist, etc. in isolation. The word ""faggot"" itself is not homophobic, and ""bitch"" is not misogynistic. It's how those words have transformed over time to demonize specific groups of people that make them bad. In other words, context matters.  The context here is that people are being attacked because people inexplicably falsely equivocate ""Chinese Virus"" to mean people of Chinese descent have it and carry into their neighborhoods.   I guarantee you if MERS were ravaging America right now we would also see a movement to refer to it by its scientific name EMC-2012 as well and instead of Asians, it would be Middle Easterns being vilified (again, or still). And I would be all for it instead of defending xenophobic rhetoric on reddit because it literally wouldn't hurt me to do so and maybe save a life or two in the process.  You have actual redditors in this very thread talking about how their lives are being affected by this type of rhetoric that emboldens racists. Posts like yours that deflect and miss the forest for the trees doesn't make things any better.  > not a reason to call somebody a racist  The past 3.5 years aside, the POTUS speaks on behalf of all Americans, does he not? If there is rhetoric that instigates violence against Americans, should he use it? Just because the word itself is just a synonym doesn't make it okay."	0

There are two things that have made me angry in all of this:  1) Donald Trump was briefed on the coronavirus as early as January, and rather than take action, chose to cut the CDC's funding instead.  2) Mitch McConnell decided to take a trip back to Kentucky to see a clerk sworn in rather than work on passing the Families First Act. The man disagreed with the act to begin with, and rather than stay in DC to negotiate tirelessly on our nation's behalf, went back to his home state for a personal event.	1

So the spurs outnumbered the Heat in 2014?  Really?  I mean, I guess 15>3.    And, yes, we agree that Lebron choked.  But with your username you should realize that the scheme that the Mavs employed on Lebron in that series had him choking.  Any time he was able to get around his man on the perimeter he was met in the lane by the Mavs zone.  The Mavs have publicly said that they wanted to just make him a passer and that's exactly what happened.  So give some credit to the Mavs braintrust while acknowledging the choke job.  (Oh, and I just watched a bunch of that finals.  Kidd did a masterful job of bodying Lebron.)	0

Sorry, but this just isn't the case. As much as I'd like it to be true, watching the Mystics and Seattle is truly an inferior product. I watched all 3 games of the WNBA Finals to really give it a chance, mostly because people were advocating it hard. I think it was all paid media or white knights that was driving that enthusiasm, because what I saw was not it.  They repeatedly turned the ball over in crunch time in Game 2... maybe Game 3 . The most egregious example was in the 4th Q was there were multiple 5 second inbound violations by both teams and I'm pretty sure there was an instance where both teams had 5 second violations back-to-back. The following possession, Elle Delle Donne (?) missed a wide-open bunny layup.  It was just a sloppy game to watch. If any NBA team played like this they would be crucified. Even the sloppiest NCAA March Madness game really couldn't compare to this product. Wish that wasn't the reality, and I expect the WNBA to improve, but it still has a long long way to go.	1

This guy is a pure hater but i get it. It must be hard watching him raw dog your team in the playoffs. Curry is the reason Harden doesnt have a ring.. Saying he didnt change anything is false. People  were skeptical about shooting 3s because analysts like charles barkley got them believing that no jump shooting team could win a title. Curry's success winning  shooting jumpshots was a validation and it blew up.   Lets address curry getting carried by his team mates. Tell me now that draymond would have been an all star if he played with harden, westbrook, cp3 ,lebron or any other elite player. Draymond'soffensive game relies on curry getting double teamed. Klay is a 41.9% 3pt shooter for his career. When curry leaves the floor, data has shown that percentage to drop to 38%. Have u ever seen klay get double teamed?. Klay is a great player but he still doesnt know how to split a double team till today because curry get all the attention. 2019 finals curry got double teamed, triple teamed, boxed and 1 while klay had single coverage on lowry who he just posted up all series. Warriors never lost because curry choked. They lost because nobody else stepped up. Curry averaged 30ppg in the finals. More than kwahi's 28ppg but raptors had 6 players that averaged double figures in that finals while warriors had just 3. Klay 26ppg and draymond 11ppg.. Tell me what iguodala and livingston achieved before joining the warriors.       Kd was known as MR Unreliable in okc because his efficiency reduced drastcally in the post season. Now he went to golden state and his efficiency skyrocketed. Kd had the most efficient years of his playoff career at golden state. Recorded his highest FG% with the warriors. Data also showed that kd became less efficient with curry off the floor. Which is why they were barely above 500 with kd and no Curry.   Curry became an allstar and an all nba player before steve kerr got there despite being snubbed a year prior. Draymond was still a bench player when curry became an all star and klay wasnt this Klay.  Im trying to understand where your notion of getting carried by team mates came from. Steph has averaged more ppg than all those team mates except kd in every season and every playoff. And dont forget he beat kd fair and square in 2016 playoffs..   Lets address the elite playmaking issue. Curry was averaging 8.5assists per game under mark jackson when he was a ball dominant guard. Steve kerr convinced him to get off ball more for the team to be more unpredictable which he did. Even Doc rivers mentioned this in a press conference. Curry is selfless and doesnt play for stats which is why they always win.Can anyone tell CP3 to give up the ball? 75% of Draymond's assists are hockey assists of curry's passes and he doesnt care. Look at the 2018 houston series, games 5, 6 and 7 curry was posting 8 and 9 apg because kerr made him ball dominant when the series was about to slip away.         Lets talk about handles. Curry's handles are elite and very efficient. He used to do elaborate handles back in the days but rarely does them now because its better to driblle less while other shooters go cold.Curry and kd had identical usage in their 3yrs together. Kd never had usage close to westbrook in any season they played together. Kyrie has better handles agreed but he prefers to dribble around while shooters go cold. You have to be living under a rock not to know that kyrie's presence has never made any team better. Tatum regressed last year because of kyrie and dinwiddle is up for a down year next year when kyrie returns.. Harden doesnt have better handles than curry. Curry handles in motion while harden dribbles life out of the shot clock at one spot..  Replace harden with curry on that rockets team and i swear  they have more success.Curry makes his teammmates better than harden can ever imagine..	0

"I asked Sam Smith the other day about Jordan's response to him personally regarding the ""Jordan Rules"" for anyone curious about what he actually said (and not the ramblings of a whiny little 12 year old above).  > I've never once spoken with him about the book. He's never said anything to me about the book. When it came out in 1991, it was very controversial. He was upset about the book - I had my doubts that he ever read it, truthfully - but he was upset with the reaction to it. At the time one of his fears was that if things came out and people changed their opinion of him and didn't like him anymore. My sense was that he thought this might or could lead to that. But I was still working for the Tribune and I was still on the beat, and still going to be there.  > The first time Jordan was in the locker room after the book came out I came up to him. I'd been an investigate reporter before going into sports writing and my editor taught me that you have to stand by a difficult story to go up to your subjects. So I went up to him - he didn't look at me, he was in the locker room sorting through tickets.  > So I said to him ""If you have any questions, anything you want to talk about, I'm here"". He didn't say anything so I went to interview other players. I would not have won any kind of battle with Michael Jordan, and to his credit he never made an issue about it, answered my questions and was still professional. We had a good relationship before that - been to dinner, invited to his room to play cards a few times, and that was over after the Jordan Rules.  > But when he came back from his first retirement in 95, he was fine. Had a few one-on-one interviews, got to know him again, and we've spoken in Charlotte. We have a good relationship and he's been nothing but professional.  > But he's never once mentioned the book, never talked about it, never said anything positive or negative to me about it."	1

> You're dense lol. He literally lost cartilage and developed arthritis. Arthritis directly leads to loss of athleticism. It's 'minor' in the sense that the injury itself has a fast recovery time but it also causes permanent damage as he's had hip issues his entire career. He went through arthroscopic surgery. The very fact that you're arguing this is fucking stupid. Just watch him play. All his speed is gone. Before the surgery, his entire gait was fucked up when walking. When running he was limping around like a clumsy 7 footer, he couldn't cut, and he couldn't jump.  Holy shit, Basketball players are soft as fuck if that's a tough injury, it doesn't get more minor than that minor injury.  > He literally did run out of luck because it was a degenerative hip issue that was affecting him for his entire career until a freak injury finally took him out. You think scoring 53 points in the playoffs is luck? You think dropping 29 a game is luck?   Yes, it is when 1 year later you become 100% garbage for no reason, I'd understand if he broke his leg in half, but he didn't get any major injury or problem.  Guy ran out of luck.  > You're the only one that actually thinks it's a minor injury lmfao.  Because it is a minor injury.   > Why do you continue to pretend that you know shit about basketball? He's the third best point guard in history. was all-NBA 7 times, and was a perennial top 7 player in his prime. You probably don't think Charles Barkley is good either, because you're not a basketball fan.  Are you fucking serious? Those are two bums who never won shit. How can you set the bar so low for your athletes? What the fuck dude...  > He was a critical role player for the championship Mavericks, and continues to be a decent contributor.  What the fuck? Quick search.  18 minutes per game in the 2011 playoffs, he was a bench player, 9 points and 4 assists per game and no defense, he got most of those points and assists in garbage time. And you want to tell me that he was good?  Get the fuck out of here you delusional manlet. Haha.  The Mavericks would have still won the championship without him... As simple as that.	1

"I got your point but the comparison was wacky, and with your clarification I think we can agree ""admirable"" is mostly subjective to which party you vote for but even if I concede he isn't admirable, he's effective and that's what's most important to me and many voters.  Not at all. There's good reason we don't utilize an overall popular vote, middle America wouldn't have their voices heard. It's just that those markets usually A. Have more people per capita than the vast majority of the country and B. Aren't diverse politically.  In fairness half of the country doesn't vote so we can't for sure say one way or the other.

Democratic socialism ‚â† socialism, he literally isn't a true socialist basing your argument around 'well if he was a true socialist' is just really dumb to begin with, like your whole argument is that him being wealthy at 78 discounts all the good he's done for humanity is just batshit. The average net worth of Americans aged 70-79 is 1.1 million he's got 2 million, really not living like some king and it's not mental gymnastics to explain to you how he inherited a home and has a one bedroom apartment to go along with his modest house.   If he wasn't a senator and house representative making the salary that he makes he wouldn't have been able to enact any change at all, and he wrote a book people decided to buy that's about him fighting for political change, doesn't go against anything he believes in, he's fine with people making money he literally just wants rich people to pay more taxes... Like I said he's advocating for extremely wealthy people to pay taxes, for the massively rich to pay their workers a fair and livable wage not 1/40,000 of what they make, for a healthcare system that will be cheaper than our current system costing the average American less while guaranteeing comprehensive coverage for every American while our current system leaves ~80mil Americans underinsured or completely uninsured and has completely reshaped the political discourse of one of two political parties in the us. Look at exit polling in literally every primary so far that shows widespread support for m4a and tell me he hasn't done anything, when soon it will become political necessity for Dems to back a policy that would keep 60k people a year from needlessly dying from lack of healthcare/ unafforable coverage. He's been the leading voice on raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and has succeeded in doing that in a number of states. He's gotten major funding for local community health centers that help the underserved with vital services. He's defended poc lgbtq and women's rights since long before it was a politically viable strategy to do so. He's pushed to stop cuts to social security and succeeded in doing so multiple times, he's fought for funding for the VA so veterans aren't abandoned by the govt they served. All this success in helping people but it's all just self serving and inexcusable for him to work in one of the few jobs that he can push for meaningful reform in bc he's given a good salary to do so??? Democratic socialism isn't about making sure no one is wealthy, it's about making sure those that aren't have sufficient safety nets to keep them from needlessly dying from lack of health coverage, lack of a living wage etc. He's argued against having massive donors backing political campaigns that lead to the wealthy having an undue say on policy, and shown that a grassroots, small donor campaign is viable. He's passed so many amendments that have helped working class people throughout the last 30 years man.  Saying he's contributed basically nothing to society is blatantly false, he might not have succeeded in every one of his efforts, but he's completely changed the political landscape of our country and the fact that he's getting 80+ % support of people 30 and under suggest that his ideas will have a very lasting impact on this country and the world	0

That's certainly an interesting take to have.  Personally I hate the lack of a headphone jack. They did a great job with the airpods but they would still work just as well on a phone with a headphone jack. People that don't want to charge headphones, pay extra, or audiophiles still prefer wired headphones. Now they can't even plug same headphones into laptop or phone without adapters.  While I'm glad I don't have to deal with all the adapters I love what they are doing with the laptop ports. USB-C can do everything the old port could do and more. I can't wait for the day when one cable can be used as a laptop charger, phone charger, and HDMI cable.	0

Ostensibly, it's a matter of supply and demand. Wine is extremely influenced by terroir (microclimate and soil conditions of the growing area), and thus you can have tiny spits of lands that create amazing wine. Domainee de la Romanee-Conti is only about 5 acres in size, and its output is so regarded that bottles have a price floor of around $10K. This is compounded by the variability in weather leading to great years (vintages) and bad years. A 2009 Bordeaux will go for hundreds more than a 2008, because '08 had shitty weather.   In reality, it's driven by marketing and hype. Oenological science (winemaking) has advanced to the point where it's hard to get a truly bad vintage. Even an '08 CdR from a good producer is really really good. I've had a 1990 Chave Hermitage and it did not justify the $400 increase in price point over a 2005.   So then it gets driven up by perceived rarity (splitting up estates into smaller and smaller micro-vineyards), hype (marketing, placement at major restaurants), and **points**. For some UNHOLY REASON, the wine world has decided that ratings are directly equivalent to a universal, non-negotiable value of a wine.   There's a 100pt scale, but anything good starts at 86 or so. Great wine starts at 91. Each point from Wine Advocate or Wine Spectator can justify adding another $80-100 to your MSRP. Robert Parker's word is gospel to the lawyers and dentists of the world who have more money than sense.   In reality, Bron is falling into the trap of buying the points and not the wine. Points are given by individual reviewers, who have their own flavor profiles that appeal to them. They are far from the gospel that they are regarded as, but instead are indicators of a single person's enjoyment of a wine. If you like light, nuanced wine, throw Robert Parker out the window, because the man loves flavor bombs. If you like the mineraly, astringent whites of Alsace and Austria, toss Spectator out, because they only like sweet, creamy whites from California.   Sorry for the rant, quarantine has me pounding coffee and writing like a madman.	0

> He grew up playing soccer and ice hockey but lived in poverty in the Saint-Michel neighborhood. He dropped out of high school at age 16 and worked as a cook and dishwasher in a St-Hubert restaurant.[3] In 2012, he was offered a spot on a tournament basketball team, and scored 44 points in the tournament final.  It seems that like Giannis, he is a soccer reject who started to play Basketball late in life because he realised that being tall is the most important thing in Basketball and he is very tall.  In 2012 he was 19 years old... He played his first Basketball game at the age of 19.   So yes, he is in the NBA just because he is very tall.  What a dumb sport.

The Sixers weren't even the second best team in their own conference.    > By very basic reasoning, the truth of how things played out suggests that we were the second best team in the playoffs  By this logic, the 49-33 Mavericks were the second best team of the 2014 playoffs because they pushed the eventual champions to 7 in the first round.

You're missing the whole point and getting mad for no reason. It's not too hard to under bud, if I were the Hawks GM I would convince the other GM's to trade with me. The reason the Hawks are so bad is because Schlenk can't do that.   A good GM makes good trades and a bad GM can't. You're calling me stupid but you think there's no difference between Billy King and Danny Ainge.	1

The governments of the world (specifically China) have an interest in how much they can control the population. Then whenever they want similar ramifications as this years virus, they can either A. Eat more bats or B. pay off the fake news media to hype up a future virus and lead to shut downs. This pandemic is an authoritarian governments wet dream for testing population control.  Of course, Reddit is also controlled by China, which is why comments like these are regularly silenced.	1
Yeah, I'm going to work under Michael Jordan with the Hornets organization and we're going to build a winning team there, while the Bulls enjoy their never ending cycle of a new front office due to not having a single winning season. Enjoy it you spoiled brats who can't appreciate what you had. I built you the Baby Bulls. That was a solid foundation that continued season after season. Do you remember the excitement? A team the city loved. I did that. Derailed by injuries, drama and Gar. I made mistakes. I failed to act appropriately with Gar. I should've fired him. My bad, but you must fail to succeed. Enjoy your crappy Bulls without me in the picture.	0
Kobe and MJ. Both overrated and both media hype. Only relevant cuz they played for big market teams and won 5 and 6 scripted rings. MJ also was in Space Jam but strictly Basketball.

That‚Äôs why I stopped listening to the media years ago, they are all a bunch of shills and liars. Just like the media has lied about all these players having the virus.

1) Basketball is inherently a star-driven sport. 5 guys on the court, 1 player can have a significant enough impact to win the game himself, usually by scoring a lot. 22 players on a football field, and look at who are the most popular, QB‚Äôs/WR‚Äôs/RB‚Äôs, the guys that do the scoring.  2) Football players wear helmets covering their face. Basketball players have their faces shown all the time.  3) Basketball is an international sport, basically just a numbers game at that point in terms of followers.

Jordan had tougher competition over the course of the entirety of the postseason altogether. Lebron only had 1 round to worry about. Lebron had his super stack super teams, MJ did it by the book from the ground up and kept his coach around. MJ had overall tougher competition and lebron had overall tougher finals opponents. That's what happens when you inspire others to follow the voltron superteam culture that he started. Beating up on Kemba walker is not a valid or notable postseason achievement.	0

"Anybody who thinks it's PG ""by far"" is actually retarded. He has had 1 season in his entire career where he was a top 10 player. Butler has been better the past 5 seasons overall than George and Klay has been better than both. 2/3rd best player on a title team and back to back finals team before KD ever joined. Super clutch playoff player unlike PG and Butler   If you think it's PG by far you just should stop talking about basketball"	0

This. Even with KLove‚Äôs and Irving‚Äôs defendive shortcomings, these three created historic offenses. The narrative of ‚ÄúJames making Love less effective‚Äù would be looked at completely differently had Love/Kyrie not been injured in 2015 and had KD not joined the Warriors in 2017.  In 2015, when they had some defenders (e.g., Shumpert who played was defending like a top 5 defensive wing),they could play both offense and defense. In their last 36 games together, they went 33-3 and had an SRS around +14 to +15.  2016 playoffs: +13 SRS (top 5 playoffs offense)  2017 playoffs: +14 SRS (best raw playoffs offense)  These are all time numbers, but sadly for them, the KD Added Turbo Warriors came about.  Take a look at these pairings:  Kobe/Shaq, +9.1, +10.9, +8.4, +10.1 in ‚Äò01, ‚Äò02, ‚Äò03, ‚Äò04 respectively; KD/Westbrook, +12.8 in 2016, +10.6 in 2015, +7.5 in 2014, +10.8 in 2013, +7.0 in 2012, +2.6 in 2011, +5.8 in 2010  James With Love, 2016,+12.0  James With Love, 2015, +11.8  James With Kyrie, 2015, +11.0  James With Kyrie, 2017, +10.2  James With Love, 2017, +10.1  Those are better numbers than the numbers Shaq and Kobe paired to put together. How can that be a failed pairing?  Lastly, about Love being ‚Äúmarginalized.‚Äù If you use a player to create an all time offense, how is he being marginalized?  2014 ‚ÄúMinny Love‚Äù per 100 possessions as a first option  35.4/17 on 59.1% TS  2017 Cavs‚Äô Love per 100 possessions as a third option  30.2/17.6 on 57.3% TS (took 2.1 fewer FGA/g per 100‚Äìequalize FGA and he‚Äôs at 32.6 ppg per 100 possessions)  2018 Cavs‚Äô Love per 100 possessions as a second option  30.8/16.2 on 61.4% TS (took 3.5 fewer FGA/g per 100‚Äìequalize FGA and he‚Äôs at 35.1 ppg AS A SECOND OPTION, almost identical to Minny Love as a FIRST OPTION; of course, with 3.5 more FGA per game, he‚Äôd basically be a co-first option with Bron)  All time playoff offensive series   Here‚Äôs a list of the best offensive series in NBA history (over the last 44 years at least); the Cavs have 5 of the top 29, i.e., 50% of all Cavs‚Äô playoff series since 2016 began have been in the top 1% of all playoff series played. They also have two best ever.

> but I'd give the benefit of the doubt to the guy running the best offense of all time  Not knocking Dallas because they are good, but they aren't even the best offense this year, in any category, how can they be the best offense of all time?  ninja: unless you are just talking about Ortg? I think that is not a good measurement personally (due to overall changes in league play, but fair enough.  another edit to doubly make sure I am clear:  ORTG is a great stat, I just don't think it is good to try and compare teams over different eras. The Mavs have a pace of ~98.something, which is like 5th best this year, with the Houston and MIL both having a much higher pace on slightly lower efficiency. '82 Nuggets is like the perfect example of the mixture of pace and efficiency. They put up 600 more points than the second most points of all time. If they had any semblance of a defense, they may have never lost, lol.	1

Yes, overall support has increased.  But still support lags significantly by certain minority segments of the US population   https://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/  That's the pew poll from this past summer.  Hispanics lag 5%.  Blacks by 11%.  Yeah, we predominantly see white faces as the front of the anti gay movement, but remember, we live in America and that is who has the loudest and largest voice. Rich, white, Male, Christian.  One also might wonder how things like age, education, income may figure in to the numbers.  Would they causes statistical skew and error?  Say for instance, a survey is done electronically.  I would imagine older and poorer people might underrepresented in the data.	1

Every superstar gets hate, for some reason.   But on top of that, Curry rose to superstardom during LeBron‚Äôs prime. Instead of having 5 or 6 rings and being the undisputed GOAT, LeBron has an abysmal 3-6 finals record which is really the main argument for him being ranked below Jordan.   Curry‚Äôs rise prevented LeBron from being recognized as the greatest ever across the NBA community. I think there‚Äôs a lot of resentment stemming from Bronsexuals for that.	0

People underrate how difficult it is to make a pass in the half-court in the NBA. You see players doing it with seemingly ease but they're all the best athletes in the world.  I feel like I'd get 5 rebounds over 82 games no problem. There are times the ball's just going to bounce your way. The 20 points would be difficult but possible mostly thanks to free throws and occasional wide open shots because the other team doesn't take you seriously. But the assists man.

It's not shocking because the country has become used to it.  American productivity since 1973 has increased by 77 percent, and if wages had kept pace with productivity, workers would be earning more than $20 an hour. Instead, over 41 million American workers ‚Äì a third of the workforce ‚Äì earn less than $12 an hour without employee-sponsored health insurance. And health costs are the number one cause of bankruptcy.    Work or be chewed apart.  You don't even deserve your health, your children don't deserve a good education, you don't deserve a safe place to live, you don't deserve equal treatment under the law... unless of course you are NOT poor. You work not because you love money but because you fear the jaws of poverty like a pack of wraiths and know your neighbors won't care to help you.	0

"Why would the ruling class of bankers and warmongers willfully put a cap on their own wealth? Why would the ruling class of billionaires willfully split up big business against their interests? Capitalism is when the ruling class of wealthy ""capitalists"" own private property and use their government to protect their interests. Capitalism is when the government steals workers' taxes to bailout Wall Street. That is unconditionally not socialism.   So you're actually advocating that workers become the ruling class, because there is no other way to exert such a cap on wealth, which means you're actually arguing for socialism, which means we need to forcefully seize land and factories and distribution networks while abolishing IP. It's good to feel this way but now it's time to stop expecting capitalism to just be better and start to study Marx and working class history"	0

Nike was selling Lebron more than an athlete merch, and a bunch of their more than an athlete ads said ‚Äústand up for something, even if it means losing everything‚Äù  > a lot of people feeling righteous from a distance might be more like Lebron than they'd hope in a similar situation.  But most of them wouldn‚Äôt have pushed a fake more than an athlete brand beforehand, and thus wouldn‚Äôt be in this same position  There‚Äôs a reason no one is criticizing the other star players as much as Lebron for the China stuff. Because none of them were profiting off more than athlete merch and doing interviews about how they won‚Äôt shut up and dribble, and then turn around and tell Morey to shut up and dribble  > Maybe expect less from Celebrities? Don't believe ads?  Again you‚Äôre missing the point. It‚Äôs not about people expecting these players to speak out about China. They didn‚Äôt. Most of the comments at the time were saying ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt speak out either‚Äù. What they did say was that athletes should shut the fuck up about being activists when they aren‚Äôt.	0

No I am giving the same energy to the Asian Community that the Asian Community gives to Black Americans.               again you never seen Black Community as a collective denigrate the Asian community. In fact Foundational Black Americans been their biggest supporters of Asians since the 1970s since they came over in masses. They set up shop in Black Communities. Their movies back in the day were supported by Black Americans.                             That level of Support has very been reciprocated by the Asian community. Instead the Asian community feel they are Honorary Whites, and perfectly fine with Racism, when its Black People on the other end of it. You have all these people running around talking about Black People need to go spend money at Asian businesses, yet Asians would never spend a dime in a Black Business even if they next door and have the stuff they need. The Asian Community wouldnt even pee on a Black Person if they were on fire. So stop with that nonsense nonexistent comparison. Black Americans historically treated Asians way better than Asians have ever treated Foundational Black Americans.                             >Or let's take those anti-semitic murders/attack in New York committed by Black men and women. I saw, sadly, quite a lot of Black people justifying that. That's fucking horrible.  That guy was an Immigrant first of all. He wasnt even a Foundational Black American. Second of all, that guy identified as Jewish, so how is he Anti Semetic?  Only Whites can be Jews now? Again he was mentally ill. Nobody justify that, nor do we claim that guy. On the other hand, Asians in Masses had protest to justify an Asian officer killing an innocent Black Man. Again show me the Black Community doing that.              >Black racism against Asians(which is very common)       No its not. You clever throwing out a lie and pretending like its equivalent. There are far more cases of Asians attacking Black People. Again you can easily find videos of Asian Shop owners attacking Black Women (one of their main consumer groups BTW). Show me how many White Women get punched and beat up by Asian Men in their Asian Shops.	0

">The end goal is a centrally planned system that allocates land for housing according to need.  So how does this work *in a practical sense?*  One obvious question is how you motivate people/companies to fund improvements to a given location. For example, I recently shelled out a decent amount of money for a number of home improvements. These ranged from ""absolutely necessary (new roof)"" to ""not necessary but contributed to the overall quality of the house (energy efficient water heater, new paint and carpet, etc).   If I don't actually own the land, then why would I ever do that? I mean, if the government can decide tomorrow to allocate my land to someone that they have ""determined"" needs it more, then why would I spend money on any of that stuff? I'd probably even put off the things like a new roof as long as I possibly could because there is nothing saying that I wouldn't get kicked out in a month and forced into another house that also needs a new roof.  I mean, do you not see that as a problem? Or do you have a realistic, practical means of still driving improvements when people don't actually own the shit that they are improving?"	0

A.) The 'average voter' doesn't understand things like federal monetary policy either, does that somehow mean it isn't fucking important?      B.) China and CCP are different things. I'm not sure you actually understand that the CCP is the political party that rules one of the two countries called 'China'.      C.) Even if you are aware of B, separation must always be drawn between a people and their government. Idk which side of the political spectrum you're on (assuming you're from the USA), but do you want to be closely identified with whatever stupid decisions Obama / Trump have made?

Old guy reporting in--  During most of his career, Malone's off-court life was reported far less than it would be in this age of social media. And in the 80s and 90s he was given much more cover than he would get today. Those of us who cared about statutory rape were in the minority.  That said, although he was a phenomenal NBA star, his on-court behavior was reprehensible enough to make him one of the most hated players in the game without bringing in his scandalous personal life. Just ask David Robinson or Isiah Thomas about Malone's flying elbows. The Postman was perhaps the most dangerous and cold-blooded player in the history of the league. Right up there with Laimbeer.	0

Nah.   If you watched the games you would see a couple of things:  1. As u/LuckysBestMan said, Brown was playing fine after recovering from his injuries. To the point where he was probably one of our most consistently good players towards the end of the season.   2. Hayward and Brown ended up working really closely for most of the season. Because they were both in charge of running the bench, you would see those two separating from the group and forming their own huddles during the game to strategise.   They went from being one of the worst duos in the league (when they were both working through injuries), to being a NET positive.  What really hurt us was the finger-pointing and that was predominantly started (at least publicly) by Kyrie and Morris.    We had team-wide problems with effort, attention to detail and communication. Kyrie and Morris made it seem like it was a youth issue and because we had a culture of finger-pointing we never developed a culture of personal responsibility.   You have to understand, Kyrie and Morris were the ones publicly speaking out the most, they ended up setting the narrative.   Fans/Media ate that shit up because there's not a whole lot of critical game analysis going on in the NBA media, most of it is highlights and regurgitated quotes.  There was a lot of unanswered hate towards Brown and Rozier early on.   And then we had two big turning points in terms of perception:  1. We actually had a former Washington Wizards' scout come into our sub with a [breakdown of a game](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/apqz7y/former_nba_scout_and_video_coordinator_bryan/). What he showed was that while Brown and Rozier were gambling too much and making junior mistakes. The really big issue was the senior players taking shortcuts and making the other guys look bad and also blaming other guys (and he tears into Morris).  * Guys weren't properly rotating defensively which would leave other defenders exposed.   * Guys weren't properly running the full length of the court in defensive transition.  * etc etc.       This is a pretty good example from our Milwaukee series of [Kyrie doing it to Morris](https://twitter.com/ZachLowe_NBA/status/1125832190967918593). Now, if that play was Kyrie and Brown and ended with Middleton getting a wide-open 3 or easy backdoor cut, what you would have seen is Kyrie calling out Brown. Even though it was Kyrie fucking up.    2. The Milwaukee series really cleared a lot of the smoke around Kyrie's on-court effort. Because he wasn't performing well offensively, people started noticing his defensive shortcomings.  On the topic of Kyrie calling out his teammates, [I did a breakdown of his Charlotte game](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/epen6c/kyrie_irving_after_tonights_loss_to_the_76ers_i/fejubuw/), but there were other examples throughout the season.	0

Finally, some positive news	0
If LeBron handpicked his teammates he could have picked a hell of a lot better ones. He could‚Äôve joined much better teams than the lakers.   LeBron doesn‚Äôt have full control over who gets signed. That‚Äôs absurd. He has input sure, but he‚Äôs not hand picking who is signed or who teams draft.   And if my aunt had a dick she would be my uncle. Players make fucking shots. That happens. LeBron scored 16 that quarter btw. Which you ignorant fools like to ignore.   Sure let‚Äôs say the cavs lose in 2016. Give me all of my hypotheticals and LeBron has a hell of a lot more than 3 rings.   Ray Allen is a hypothetical because he didn‚Äôt miss.   I never mentioned 2011 as that is obviously a stain on his legacy.   No one is removing him of blame you numb nuts. We just actually have a brain and use it to provide context.	0

"> No they don't lol, you don't know what you're talking about  No 5 footers in the last All Star game.   Isaiah Thomas the hero of manlets has already been kicked out of the NBA for being shit.  > Jokic is one of the best passers in the league, leads the league in game winners, and is already the best passing center of all time.  There are 3 billion 5 footers in the world and you are going to tell me that not a single one of them is better than that bum?  Very easy to pass the ball when you see everyone from above and it's hard as fuck to block you because you are 7 foot tall.  >  Thon Maker is a good example. He is athletic and is said to have a great work ethic by everyone, but he's mediocre.  Quick Google search: ""When he was 14, Maker was discovered by Edward Smith...   At first, Maker was reluctant to leave the soccer field behind to focus on organized basketball... At that time Thon was spending his time playing soccer, and had never played basketball a day in his life.""  ""I said no, not because of him, but just I didn‚Äôt want to play basketball,"" Maker explained. ""But after trusting in him and going along with the plan, he said, 'Trust me, trust me.'""   Another case of a Soccer reject being told to pursue a Basketball career because Basketball is easy money for very tall dudes... Holy shit there are many many cases of lazy very tall people choosing Basketball for easy money.  Thon Maker is a lazy dude, he couldn't make it in soccer, a sport where you can make a decent living in thousands of teams (each team has like 22 players)... Yet, he quit and switched to Basketball at the age of 14 and is earning millions in the NBA already even if he doesn't give a fuck about the sport.  > The reason the other antetokounmpo brothers have contracts is so teams can lure in Giannis.  The NBA is the dumbest shit ever haha.  > By the way, Giannis is known for having a crazy work ethic lol.  A European Soccer reject has crazy work ethic... Holy shit, if you think a bum like him has work ethic then that explains why the US sucks at European sports like Rugby and Soccer. You have no idea what work ethic means mate.  > you also need to understand that even soccer players require a lot of natural talent. Every single sport requires natural talent and athleticism to compete at the top. Messi is insanely quick and coordinated. Ronaldo is one of the most athletic guys on the planet. Basketball isn't much different.  That's insulting, you will never see rejects form other sports making it to the top of Soccer, let alone reject from other sports that were developed by countries with no soccer infrastructure.  Messi and Ronaldo started to play Soccer at age 4 and worked their assess off, they left their families behind at the age of 11 to go the Barcelona academy (Messi) and Sporting Lisbon (Ronaldo), that's work ethic... They are at the top because of hard work, Messi and Ronaldo are not gifted athletes, Messi looks like a retard and Ronaldo looked like this at the age of 18 [before and after](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/huUuBVRPTKk/maxresdefault.jpg)  It's insulting to compare Giannis, a soccer reject who switched to Basketball late in life to make easy money with Messi and Ronaldo, the hardest workers in sports.  Basketball is based on being tall, sports like soccer are based on hard work, skills and sports IQ."	0

"...and then they revolted again and again until finally establishing a system that stuck. That's the point. Nobody's saying that the people who took over after the Bourbons were paragons of virtue.  The French revolutions lessened religious interference in politics, reshaped land ownership and did away with tithes and religious taxation that kept the farmers eternally poor, inspired the destruction of multiple oligarchies which led to economic boom across Europe and laid the groundwork for multiple modern ideologies. It was worth the struggle.  We're literally living in a timeline where the American government is openly debating how many workers are worth killing to make sure the rich don't get slightly less rich. Your response to perhaps the most successful political revolution of all time has to be more than ""but it sounds hard""."	0
>I should have said Lakers instead  That's fair; I pull no punches when it comes to talking about the Lakers but honestly, it's no worse than what I've seen Laker fans say about the Lakers in their own team sub.  And if it makes you feel better, I used to do the same thing to the Warrior fans as well, but they've noticeably disappeared this year.  >no better than someone thinking x is paid by Ballmer.  This is exactly one of them. I've read comments that have mentioned how Kawhi and Collison screwed you guys over. I've read comments about how Ballmer is paying Moe Harkless to not ask for a buyout to prevent him from going to the Lakers. I've read comments about how Ballmer probably paid Collison to lie to the Lakers and trick them into thinking he was coming so they'd make no moves at the deadline.  So if we're just blindly throwing out accusations, might as well join the party.	1

The Nets are not better with DLo as there #1 in any way. Neither are the Celtics.

Then like my franchise he continues to deteriorate at a snail's pace with the incompetent fucks he brings in to fix things lacking the wisdom to do anything other than make them worse.  He's lived a lavish lifestyle of gluttony and greed, spent more money without a second thought on whether he could afford it than any of us put together will likely ever earn in our lifetimes and treated his workers like he treats the team he owns, like trash  If this virus is going to take so many undeserving then it better take at least one person that does, and I can think of parasite on God's green Earth more deserving than James fucking Dolan  Edit: Hahahaha 13 MINUTES LATER I GOT THE BAN, THAT'S GOTTA BE SOME SORT OF RECORD	0

No.  This is the problem with the media and trying to create mass hysteria by attaching the word 'deadly' to every headline because it's 'technically' correct.  The figures aren't completely settled but the from a few articles, just based off the amount of confirmed cases v. those who have died from it, the mortality rate is estimated to be between 2-4%. Obviously, there are cases that won't be noticed and deaths that will be 'missed' in the count. Those who are dying include the elderly and the immunocompromised.  But even then, to put in perspective, look at the annual influenza virus. I'd say most people consider it kind of a shitty nuisance to get around the holiday times, but the perception of the annual flu isn't marked by media outrage and fear mongering. The mortality rate for those aged 50-64 is about 9%.	1

CCP definitely has their problems, suppression of free speech, etc but non related to COVID19.  &nbsp;  Most Countries (including USA, Canada, Italy, etc), squandered time that they had to act.  Taiwan/Singapore has done a great job according to news articles.  &nbsp;  Some moot points that people brought up with respect to how other countries have responded.  1. China suppressed the Doctor that raised awareness about this. True, this was done at a state level. People have been fired for the suppression. The suppression doesn't affect the time other countries have wasted. 1. China is under reporting numbers. True, but so is every one else. The lack of testing capacity, and the virus being new affected this. We saw (in Feb) how fast this spread in China & the drastic measures they took to curb the spread but other countries just sat idle.   Unclear points against China.  1. Wave 2 numbers are unclear.  Clear points against China  1. The prevention of WHO to give information to Taiwan  This by no means is a complete list of points.  That being said, we need to be careful about the 2nd wave of Corona virus.	0

Whenever Hakeem defended Shaq he was basically rendered useless, and Hakeem stopped him so many times. Shaq said himself that the way he played against opposing big men was to get in their heads; Hakeem had none of that. Shaw admitted himself Hakeem got in HIS head, not the other way around. If Hakeem was on the Magic, it would‚Äôve at least been a 7 game series. It‚Äôs not even like the Rockets cast was that much better than the Magic team. Hakeem dominated the whole series, and there‚Äôs a reason the Knicks took him to 7, whereas the Magic got swept. :) Also I dont know why so many of you are dick riding Shaq lmao, this is Shaq before his prime, not in his prime. Smh. And here‚Äôs a saying for you: Skill always beats brute force; and hard work beats talent when talent doesnt work hard enough. Hakeem is arguably the most skilled player of all time, and Shaq at the point in his career literally only used brute force. Hakeem outskilled him tremendously.	0

So basically create a good team filled with veteran role players and stock up on assets to pull the trigger when a superstar becomes available.  Sounds like a good strategy, but I think there are so many ways to screw it up.  Just looking at the Pistons, they really don‚Äôt have any assets outside of Luke Kennard and wasted their one opportunity to stockpile some more by not trading Drummond earlier.  Also keep in mind it‚Äôs extremely difficult to win a championship in the NBA.  I‚Äôd say you need at least one top 5 and one top ten player and competent vets, or three players in the 10-15 range or better just to be in contention.  So even if the Pistons were getting a healthy peak performance Griffin, it still wouldn‚Äôt be enough.  Also the sixers were stacked with top end talent and still lost in round two (embiid, Butler, Simmons Harris are all in the 8-15 range).	0

The minimum salary is $582,000. That‚Äôs $7097 per game before taxes (say $8000 because it‚Äôs easier math)  $8000 * 65 games is $520,000 before taxes earned to date (most teams have played around 65 games)  That‚Äôs around $300,000 after taxes.   If you‚Äôre broke after making that much since October and are living paycheck to paycheck then you‚Äôre absolutely retarded  The minimum salary is $893,310 not $582,000 so my math is wrong.

Yup, this is also true of the great depression (and recessions in general).

How will quarantine increase the duration of this pandemic? If people are inside and not in contact there will be less cases, hence, with time, it'll go away. If we all stayed inside for the next month without leaving our homes once, it would go away because there wouldn't be more infections.  If you know that you playing basketball doesn't help this situation and could be putting people at risk if in touch with them, why are you still doing it? We all know it's hard to stay home for a long period of time but the longer we adjourn this isolation, the longer the virus will be around (contrary to what you've been stating), just make an effort, for the sake of everyone else that is doing that effort, to be careful. You can take all precautions but if you're playing Basketball with someone that is infected (and you can't know for sure who is and isn't) all those precautions are just wasted.	0

You retard everyone was downplaying it in February and even in March. Nancy Pelosi told people to go out and not worry Feb 24, De Blasio was telling people the same thing the second week of March.

You're funny. A troll post? How?   Everything i said is true  He didn't get half the defensive attention any star in NBA history on those teams, Supper inefficent and bad playmaking playoff games were not rare for KD before he joined the warriors and the team he joined without him won  - 67 games  - NBA championship  - 73 games  - 3rd longest win streak ever  - Made B2B finals  - 3 years later they finished off houston, swept portland, made another finals and took the raps to 6 despite 2 klay injuries    Trolling?

You can only use a trend line and marked differences (like that between blacks and whites, which has a 10% difference).	1

I think the highest rate is 0.2% for people under the age of 55 and that's only deaths/(confirmed cases) which means that it's way less than that because if you do deaths/(unconfirmed + confirmed + asymptomatic) then the rate can only go down. Consider that Vo, Italy is the only city to test all of their population of 1350 after the first person showed symptoms and they discovered that 103 people already had it but showed 0 signs and felt fine. That means more than 99% of the population may have an opportunity to get it and he completely unaffected.  Initial reports estimated 33% of people are unaffected. A week later they estimated 70-90% of people are unaffected. The only numbers that aren't estimates shows greater than 99% may not be effected by the virus.  We still need to look out for the 1% though.  I'm just stating that the numbers are thankfully in most people's favor.	0

Neither of you all know very much I‚Äôm willing to bet and with all due respect I‚Äôve read no leagues across the globe in sports from soccer to American football to the nba speaking on no fans until a vaccine. Please stop the pessimistic views and let researchers find and develop treatments. And please before any predictions let‚Äôs see if treatments improve enough where hospitals can cope with the virus before going into emergency mode. This is much about treatments and research seen? While working on vaccines you understand.   Everyone needs to stop predicting the fall and definitely 2021 while we are in the spring of 2020. The way this thing impacted society so quickly is the same way things may change for the better. Until then please shut the fuck up with negative predictability shit you all have prolly done very little research on.	0

"> You think there's absolutely no reason for former teammates to dissipate contraversy with diplomatic responses? When did you start watching sports?  He can give a diplomatic response without giving him a glowing recommendation and absolving him of all blame.  > I never said dlo was better, I said they were comparable. As in they're both inferior guards who will never contend for championships as the main piece. At the end of the day I'm sure the Celtics would have rather had dlo than Kyrie Irving, the Celtics would rather have an inferior kemba walker than Kyrie too.  And again, they aren‚Äôt comparable in any way. I promise you the Celtics would rather have Kyrie than DLo and Kemba. In fact they tried re-signing Kyrie even *after* all the drama. They only settled on Kemba after Kyrie chose the Nets.  > Where are your ""facts""? You provided anecdotes and opinions and absolutely no facts.  Fact: Kyrie is much better at basketball than DLo  Fact: Tatum and Brown‚Äôs progression is natural and not a cause of Kyrie being gone  Fact: Not a single front office in the league would choose DLo over Kyrie  > And no, me calling you an idiot is not me being personally invested.

Man this is overstated. Yes it's 'rape' according to law but when you grow up in the 80s and 90s you saw college dudes banging teenagers left and right. Celebrities did this all the time. That's why it's a bigger deal now than it was 20 years ago. I am not saying Malone isn't a dick, he definitely is the way he trested his children.

If I had to guess it‚Äôs because Hockey cares even more about masculinity than basketball does. The culture is all about being tough and masculine, not letting an injury keep you out of the game, dudes are literally allowed to fight each other, etc.   I also read an article where they were saying that hockey is more of a team first game that has less focus on individualism and that players would feel like they‚Äôre disrupting the team and causing a distraction by airing out their personal lives. I can see this as there are far fewer personalities in the NHL than there are in the NBA or even the NFL.	1

Check out the pivotal game 6. LeBron actually had a better game. 41 points on 16/27 vs. his 41 points on 16/30 in game 5. He also scored 18 straight for the Cavs during a crucial 3rd quarter/4th quarter stretch where Klay went supernova and the Warriors cut a 20+ point lead to 7. Kyrie was crazy in game 5, but his impact wasn't anywhere close in game 6 where Draymond returned.	0

"Assume by some natural process you detweilerTeej started turning into the opposite gender.  If you're a guy and you start growing breasts and losing muscle you will likely hate it, opposite is true for a girl who's starts growing larger and more hairy with a deeper voice.  You would likely feel like you are in the wrong body.   Its not so much physical ""damage"", its physiological. I'm not very invested in trans issues but at least as far as trans people *feel* that's the comparison.    Blockers basically buy time to make sure a kid really has gender dysphoria, and gets them closer to mental maturity so they can be more equipped to decide.  Downsides are not really known but at least from the available stats seem to strongly outweigh the psychological damage of making/letting someone go through puberty as the ""wrong"" gender."	1

The point is that this wouldn't happen in today's NBA without criticism. But because it's Kobe, everyone ignores the obvious flaw in decision making. He could have passed to Slava and got a handoff-screen for a much easier look.  It's quite clear that his teammates' general lack of activity on the play shows that they knew Kobe had no intention of passing, even if he was forced to take a ridiculous low-percentage shot. And their muted reaction immediately afterward speaks volumes of their opinion of him in this moment.	0

Lol you are so far In denial jesus christ and it got removed by mods because it was a dumb ass question since its obviously Kyrie right now, and it's clearly not just me who thinks that judging by the popular responses, only nephews such as your self think Tatum, I.e 90%of Boston fans. Who know nothing about basketball besides the Boston games they watch believe what you are attempting to argue lmao  Also you keep citing net rating when it's useless for 1 season,  it's a stat that's only accurate over a massive  sample size, but I wouldn't expect a casual to know that.	1
When Harden goes off he takes a hell of a lot more scoring possessions than other superstars. You‚Äôre showing the reading comprehension of a 10 year old  FGA in games with 50 or more points in the last few years  Harden: 39, 38, 37, 34, 34... 28, 27, 26 25, 24 (5/18 are below 30 attempts)  Curry: 24  KD: 31, 27  Giannis: 31, 26  LeBron: 34, 31  Lillard: 23, 26, 28, 29, 33, 37  Of the others (7/13 are below 30 attempts)  This better for you? The stats. They all do it on less attempts even though Harden takes the most free throws hmmm  Edit: Lol and it‚Äôs downvoted quicker than you could even read it, god that‚Äôs embarrassing ü§°	0

Doubt you will look into this, you'll probably just keep your head in the sand. 2009, 4g roll out. Swine Flu outbreak. 3g rolled out in 2001 - SARS outbreak 2002. Radio towers massively rolled out. Radio towers massively rolled out in 1910 - Spanish Flu outbreak in 1912.   5G rolled out....first in Wuhan China. 2nd in Spain. Third in Italy. Then the US (major port cities..NY, LA, Seattle).   Do you see a pattern? It may be nothing, but it is absolutely a pattern worth looking at.  The WHO seems radio frequency radiation as carcinogenic.  5G is used in WEAPON SYSTEMS for crowd control. 5G¬†Network Uses Same EMF Waves As Pentagon¬†Crowd Control¬†System. ... Among the many potential problems with exposure to¬†5G¬†radio waves are issues with the skin, which is interesting when you consider that this¬†technology¬†is already being used in the military for¬†crowd control¬†purposes.

Funeral/Memorials are interesting events.    There are people there who 100% don't like the idea of laughing at this thing.  I remember a few years ago my friend's grandmother died and the wake was incredibly morbid.  Like no talking, total silence except occasional murmurs.  Then my grandmother died a month later and I don't know maybe it's because we're Irish or something but everybody's making jokes and laughing and telling funny stories about her.   Just interesting how different people handle grief.  When you get an entire arena full of people I'd imagine you aren't going to kill with a joke entirely.	1

Harden is a waaaaaaaaaay better offensive player, DWade had moves but he was a very limited shooter, got the line, but had a bad FT shooting for a guard.   Harden is also very underrated defensively. Nevertheless, Wade is better defensively overall and on his prime he was DPOY-level in 08/09 after Beijing, but the most important thing is that he is much more consistent overall.   So until consistency matters it‚Äôs even, when it matters throughout tough playoff series when you can‚Äôt fall below your level on every single night, it‚Äôs advantage to DWade which is crucial.	0

>CDC estimates 80% of the country gets this thing before it's over. That's 256 million people. 2% of that is over 5 million  This is a huge distortion. The range I've read is from 40% to 70%, and the vast majority of cases are mild (80%).  You do a huge disservice by automatically projecting the worst case scenario.  If Italy is the worse case, the avg age of those that died is in the 80s.   People *need* to go back to work. Millions live paycheck to paycheck - they cannot just not work. Unrest can lead to looting and violence, which can also overload the system.  Again, you have very little life experience to understand the downstream effects. Your view is myopic - you only understand the hysteria in front of you, and you immediately jump to the worst case scenario *as your base case*. A complete fallacy.	1

Yeah but Kawhi just being there off the ball is such an offensive threat that people can finally recognize why players like him, Durant, Kobe and Jordan are so good, without them you can still have a full offense that will run well. If Harden or LeBron had a bad 4th quarter then the entire team would have done bad because they are the entire offense, they have the ball in their hand all the time and add less off the ball (LeBron because he can‚Äôt shoot as well and Harden for some reason chooses not to). Kawhi literally only took 14 shots in 4 fourth quarters COMBINED like you said which is absolutely nothing- even if he missed all those shots they barely hurt the offense because even though he missed most of his shots he barely took any. At least when he‚Äôs not shooting the ball, his all star point guard can facilitate and the entire team at least has the chance to ball without him. Imagine a pass first point guard like Lowry playing with LeBron lol he would not have the series he had because he simply wouldn‚Äôt get the touches and wouldn‚Äôt have the same options when he has the ball in his hand. If Kawhi had that same percentage on more shots then it would be a different story and if they lost. Not to mention when he actually does get the ball, the other team doubled him way more than they do LeBron (but not as much as Harden) so even if he‚Äôs not getting the points and assists, he‚Äôs changing the shape of the defense in a way that helps him team tremendously. I know everyone won‚Äôt share the same opinions but I think it‚Äôs a testament to Kawhis greatness that he can take his foot off the brakes and still see his team do well only because I rarely ever see that from high usage guards like LeBron and Harden.   I‚Äôm only talking about LeBron and Harden because you mentioned them not because I hate them but you understand my point.  TL;DR he‚Äôs not criticized because Kawhi helps his team win even when he‚Äôs not putting up the stats.	0

I have a funny story about Boston: little over a decade ago I moved to NYC and had a friend living in South Boston. I was waiting on a job so I went up there to stay for a bit. We were getting around on bikes and I was riding my friends girlfriends bike as I didn‚Äôt have one. It was this pink mountain bike looking thing. Well as we‚Äôre riding down the street I hear a loud noise hit my spokes, a decent size stick. I turn around shocked to see a what looked like a 12 year old? Say ‚Äúnice Bike Fag*ot‚Äù. I start laughing because it was a pretty wild scene. He follows it up with a ‚Äúwetback‚Äù.   Im not implying anything about Boston fans. In fact I have a gay cousin raising adopted kids with his partner there too who are big fans. Will just never forget that story.	1

"You seriously think Kobe is top 15? He's not even close, look at advanced stats for a second, if you're smart enough to understand them I mean.  Let me put down my classwork for my Advanced Applications in Statistics class at MIT Open Courseware for a second to teach you a little something about how mathematical models work. You probably couldn't even begin to comprehend how the models I work on in my spare time work, but I'll try anyway. It's good to pass on the knowledge, especially to those who are not well endowed in the analytical side of things.  You must be one of those Lakers fans that thinks championships are actually important, completely ignorant to the fact that any legendary player (Duncan anyone?) would take a 55 FG% than some useless jewelry ring anyday.  You don't know anything about the PER valuations and the metrics used to accentuate intricate sample sets about autonomous principles that can be extracted to show that Kobe Bryant has never actually hit a game winner in his career. All his game winners are media hype tapes to sell shoes. Kobe is very fortunate that he's marketed so well by Nike and the Lakers franchise.  ESPN and the whole 'next Jordan' narrative has you thinking Kobe is clutch but he's not, every data point that was graphed on the Cartesian plane while prime factorization was allowed to exist in a null factor showed that Kobe continued to fail theses primitive tests. I studied statistical variations in geometric localities and each and every one of their correspondent asymptotic differentiations provided me with the conclusion that your so called Kobe is the worst clutch shooter in the NBA.  Cosine functions developed at Princeton while combined with the Bell curve allows us to measure basketball production without affecting Higgs Boson-like particles that would otherwise exist in non-zero environments. And where do you think Kobe ranks on that scale? The bottom of the Bell Curve. They ran about ten thousand trials of the same repeating polymorphic routes emulating artificially generated synergy optimization and the Mamba was nowhere to be found in either planes. ""Eye tests"" are a layman's tool for avoiding thinking and this kind of narrow tunnel vision only exacerbates current falsifications that we can rely on such a poor method of extrapolation. I don't watch basketball but the fact of the matter is that I don't need to. It's all in the stats. The numbers don't lie.  Your ""Kobe"" is just an average NBA player who gets an ungodly amount of touches thanks to his marketing. Kobe was never the best player in the league, nor even a top 250 player in the league at any point in his career. I wish people understood more the numbers side of basketball and woke up and finally realized that this guy not only is overrated, but flat out isn't good at basketball in any way whatsoever"	1

You can't compare US to Europe (or Euroleague) fans actually and it is not about freedom of speech. The difference is, if an owner of a Euroleague team would act like this (doesn't give a shit about team) fans would just **tell him to go KYS and STOP going to games**. Dolan's advantage is that **people do actually STILL go to games=CASH FLOW** (i guess to watch enemy teams/stars?). At Europe's culture each team has an organized fans' club (unofficially connected to team)  that follows the team (when they play away) and act like soccer hooligans.   Also vast majority of NBA fans are actually about the star player and not the team they watch.  You can see a comparison of fans between US and Euroleague here  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWrSw3X8TRs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWrSw3X8TRs)    At Europe its only about winning, at NBA its about enjoying game even if you lose :P	1

This is pretty much just pandering (the only thing DeBlasio knows how to do). Critically ill patients don't need testing either. Having the test result does nothing to alter the treatment for those people. They are treated exactly the same whether they are confirmed to have COVID-19 or not.  Its actually better to use the tests on healthy asymptomatic people you think might have been exposed because you can use the knowledge from the test to quarantine people who aren't showing symptoms.  So Bill, shut the fuck up and go back to being a useless piece of shit and let the grownups work.	0

Alright boys here‚Äôs my two cents. Is calling it the ‚ÄúChinese Virus‚Äù racist? No. Will calling it the ‚ÄúChinese Virus‚Äù cause some morons I‚Äôm on country to lash out at Asian-Americans? More than likely, yes.  I agree with China getting shit for this. They had SARS, then Bird a Flu, and now Corona Virus. It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous that they practically churn out a new epidemic each decade. Even worse, at least from my understanding, the origins are all similar. It always starts inside some unregulated wet or live market.  However, calling it the China Virus will do more harm than good. Unfortunately, some idiot out there will hear ‚ÄúChina Virus‚Äù and likely take it out on innocent Asian-Americans. People are dumb and hateful, and will use any reason they can to get riled up.   I just think looking at it from everyone‚Äôs perspective, the best thing to do would be to call it the coronavirus or whatever. We can still give China shit and keep the virus name neutral.	1

I disagree, it is not a transphobic point to question or wonder otherwise. Where are you getting that 1%? How many people regret without going through the pain of transitioning back?

To people like that person in the video and others. Also I feel my point about Kim Petras shows that I don't believe the feeling of being born in the wrong sex is some delusion.	1

Dude was on under armours books after Nike rejected him. All he wanted was a basketball camp for kids which Nike refused but gave to Kyrie.im sure kyrie has such a functioning basketball camp or maybe parents like him so much that they refuse to let their kids attend his camp  for the fear of having their kids telling them how flat the earth is. I bet if he was on Nike's books they would have given him.  Nike messed up as badly as Adidas messed up when they didnt give Jordan that contract.. Now they are trying to kill his brand because they know how much appeal he has..	0

"They could have offered him the larger extension this previous offseason. The article is referring to the offseason before that, when Kyrie and the Celtics were in good terms. Since the season happened, the Celtics made absolutely no attempt to re sign hkm despite having the chance to offer him a bigger extension than any other team before free agency began.  You're completely changing your ""facts"" about the Celtics waiting for Kyrie then only going after Kemba when Kyrie left..  Kemba signed with Boston when Kyrie was still a free agent..  Your facts aren't actual facts."	0

You didn't. I didn't.   But we aren't rape trial fans. We are basketball fans. And at the end of the day whatever happened in CO doesn't affect how good a basketball player he is and how transcendent that was- and quite honestly how transcendent a person he was in every other moment of his life.   People care about basketball. I mean Derrick Rose is literally stupid. And has made immoral choices in college and with women, people don't care at all.	0

Not defending Harden, but what is the defensive strategy here by MCW? Full back turn so Harden can wander off? If you're going to ball deny that hard at least face the man you're doing it to.     It's a hilarious flop but the defense is almost equally bizarre.	0

I hope North Americans will finally start realizing what is actually happening.
