If you raise minimum wage, you raise the wages of all other workers currently making more than minimum wage, and it doesn nothing but harm people. This money isn't coming out of thin air, and it isn't coming out of businesses pockets, either. They will raise prices to compensate. Every single time.   Minimum wage is literally a scam that hurts everyone EXCEPT people who are unwilling to improve themselves and politicians who get in votes based off of those policies.   Fuck the minimum wage. Fuck it so hard.  Literally creates unemployment.  Edit: Everyone thinks that raising the minimum wage takes money out of the pockets of evil billionaires. Go look at the average Amazon hourly wage for a warehouse worker. Seriously. Look that shit up.   You are DESTROYING small businesses. Especially ones that operate on thin margins, like the restaurant industry.  Y'all need to educate yourself on this. It's a necessity. We have got to stop voting for minimum wage increases. McDonald's cashier is NOT supposed to be a career choice.	1

>Y'all thought he was about to let them miss the playoffs    Lillard was non existent garbage for too many games, that's why Portland are in this position in the first place. CJ is yet to have a great game this season as well. Too inconsistent   Now Lillard is on a crazy run.. but there's still a LONG way to go. Portland still out of the playoffs. Spurs are right there as well, hunting for that 7th-8th seed.   >  I can see Grizzlies falling off, but if they don't.. That's bad news for Portland. Lillard can keep on dropping 50s, but they are in a drowning position now, trying to swim back up. Half of the season is almost done.  Even a single more loss right now will hurt them way too much	1

Well, we are constantly changing words and name because it has racist connotation. For example here in Sweden we had a pastry that was called n****boll, but around 90's, the n-word started to have a racist connotation here because of the similarity between it and the English word(mostly because of American movies and TV show). So now its called chokladboll.   So, if it really is so racist as some claim, its not pointless to change the name of the Spanish flu..	0

**Will McGee, athletic director at Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary, lifelong friend:** I‚Äôve been playing basketball with ‚ÄôBron since we were 8, and he‚Äôs always been good. But some of the things he does now, he did back when he was a kid. If he took a hit or something, he would be down for a while. You don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs hurt or if he‚Äôs not.  We were in eighth grade, playing in the Indiana Black Expo tournament. Good tournament, we make it to the championship. And we‚Äôre getting our doors blown off. We‚Äôre losing by 20-plus. So he goes down, hard foul, because when you‚Äôre good they‚Äôre always trying to foul you hard. We‚Äôre pushing, trying to get people away from him, make sure he‚Äôs cool, and one of our coaches called us over, one of our assistant coaches, while our head coach was out there tending to him. I remember him distinctly saying, ‚ÄúNow, mind you, we‚Äôre still in this game. We gotta stay focused. LeBron may be hurt, or he may not be hurt. We don‚Äôt know. We don‚Äôt know, but we gotta keep playing.‚Äù  And we‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúAll right, he‚Äôs right, we gotta keep playing.‚Äù So we come back, tie the game. We end up going to overtime. LeBron missed the rest of the game, in regulation. But then in overtime he‚Äôs all right to play. Comes back, scores 20 points, maybe like 12 in a row. We end up winning by 10. And when I tell you we were laughing the rest of the way home after we won that tournament. He was like, ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt feel my arm or leg for a minute. But I knew I had to get back out there and help. I had to do something.‚Äù  We said, ‚ÄúYeah, after we tied it up, I bet you did want to bring it on home.‚Äù That is etched in stone in my head.  We were in practice one day and he went down and did that, and coach was like, ‚ÄúGet up! I get scared every time you go down. My heart drops every time you start rolling on the ground. Get up if you ain‚Äôt injured.‚Äù  Man, that‚Äôs been him. He takes his time getting up.  **George Hill, Milwaukee Bucks, former Cavs teammate:** When I think of LeBron, I don‚Äôt think of what he does on the court; I think of what he does off the court that makes him special. For me, the things he does as far as endorsement-wise, him having a Beats deal, making sure all of us have Beats, and numerous pairs of them. I think I have so many Beats, shitloads of them in my closet because we got so many. Him having that Thom Browne suit deal, getting all of us three suits and shoes and glasses and headphones to match the suits.  Stuff like that, that you don‚Äôt really read about or see about, I think that‚Äôs what kind of makes him special. It‚Äôs the thought, because he didn‚Äôt have to do none of that. He‚Äôs his own man and he doesn‚Äôt have to include us in anything, but he knows that we‚Äôre all a team and we‚Äôre all together and he looks out for his teammates a lot.  **Steve Kerr, Golden State Warriors coach, four-time Finals adversary:** I remember his rookie year, when he went to Cleveland, his rookie year was my first year broadcasting. My first year out of the league, and I went to do a game. And I met his mom, and his mom said, ‚ÄúSteve Kerr, you‚Äôre a bad man. I was like, ‚ÄúOK, that‚Äôs cool. LeBron‚Äôs mom just called me a bad man.‚Äù That‚Äôs a great feeling.  **Kevin Love, Cleveland Cavaliers, former Cavs teammate:** D-Wade has said it before and I hate that I have to quote him. But when we go international, which is obviously always Toronto, he won‚Äôt turn on his phone. It‚Äôs only WiFi. He‚Äôs the cheapest fucking guy. He‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs bullshit. I won‚Äôt turn on my phone.‚Äù He won‚Äôt turn on data roaming. He‚Äôll only go when we‚Äôre either at the arena or at the Shangri-La, ‚ÄúHey, what‚Äôs the WiFi?‚Äù Internationally and in Toronto, he‚Äôll never pay for it.  ***From Team Banana Boat ‚Ä¶***  **Chris Paul, All-Star, Oklahoma City Thunder, former Team USA teammate**: The night before Game 4 (of the 2007 Finals), that‚Äôs when his son was born. Bryce. Yeah, I was there. I was coming to the Finals games, so I was staying with him. It was my first or second year in the league, and we were at the house. And, Vannah (LeBron‚Äôs wife, Savannah) had gone to the doctor, and I think called back to the house and said, ‚ÄúI think my water broke,‚Äù or something like that. And me and him got in the car to go to the Cleveland Clinic. We were there all night. Me and LeBron, Randy (Mims), Mav (Maverick Carter), Rich (Paul) his mom, all of us.  We were there all night, and then just waiting for Bryce to be born. He had Game 4 of the Finals the next day. Man, we were playing cards, we were doing all types of stuff. We were waiting, waiting for Vannah to deliver the baby. I remember she had him late, and we went back to the house. It was late, late. Crazy. Obviously, they got swept the next day.  **Dwyane Wade, TV analyst, 13-time All-Star, former Heat, Cavs, Team USA teammate:** With LeBron, I got a chance to see him at his lowest, after the 2011 Finals. When it came to losing in the Finals with the Heat, and not living up to his own and everyone else‚Äôs expectations. I watched him take it all on the chin and pick himself up off the ground and embraced it all. He bet on his work ethic and pure love for the game.  **Carmelo Anthony, Portland Trail Blazers, 10-time All-Star, former Team USA teammate:** Him being better with his left hand than his right hand. He does everything. He throws with his left, he writes with his left. He does everything with his left. When you see stuff like that, when you see people that can do things the same with both hands, whether it‚Äôs sports or regardless of what it is, that‚Äôs a special person. I don‚Äôt know too many people who can do that. I know one other person, probably Russ (Westbrook). Russ writes with his left and does things with his left, then gets on the court and won‚Äôt go left (laughs). These guys are one-of-a-kind when it comes to that.	1

This is ridiculous.   Kevin Garnett would talk about your wife, parents getting cancer, people dying.   Kobe Bryant called a ref a fag on national television, cheated on his wife and settled a sexual assault case. He made it up to her with a an 8 million dollar diamond ring.  There are other players that literally tried to kill their coach (Sprewell) that don't get as much shit as D Wade does. Dude has some bad on-court moments but what he has done for representation of fathers, black fathers, gay, trans, and all he has done for Chicago, Miami, and some specific people should far outweigh that.	0
You brought up his base as a point for why they shouldn‚Äôt oppose him. Hitler had supporters. Stalin had supporters. That doesn‚Äôt make them good leaders. More people disapprove than approve of Trump also so that point doesn‚Äôt even really make sense.	0

Every single time he touches the ball you foul him.  There is no way a player of his size would be able to shoot even 25% from the line.     You can't have less than five people on the court so you just save your five best players to foul out last.  Hagrid is also way too large and slow to be able to play both defense and offense so either way you are playing 5v4 on one side of the court	0

Stop trolling? You're the one that replied   70% of your comments are bronsexual love or curry hating. Weird af, I vaguely remember your name because you're out there debating everyone about how Curry is overrated. I guess you remember me for destroying your arguments one by one. Last thing, I barely talk about LeBron, I couldn't give 2 shits about that guy. I don't think he's the GOAT so you probably got all offended when I make arguments in such topics. Top 3 players I comment on are Curry, Wilt, Kyrie, and Harden, that's it.	0
> The Grizzlies made it known what their asking price for Evans was (a first round pick), and various teams around the league decided not to give the Grizzlies what they wanted. Wallace decided it was in the team‚Äôs best interest to keep Tyreke in hopes of re-signing him this summer. Wallace was definitely stubborn in his approach, **demanding a first round pick and not accepting some of the rumored alternative deals.**  That‚Äôs the key part there. Teams were still willing to give up *something* for Evans, just not a first rounder. Either way, it‚Äôs a very different situation than a player potentially getting bought out.  By the way, I understand you‚Äôre a Lakers fan and expect things to get handed to you just because, but you‚Äôre not getting Iggy for free, end of story.	1

No thats nowhere near a realistic portrayal of the situation. This virus kills the old and already sick, for the absolute majority it will be similar to a flu. Mass unemployment and a deep depression is much more dangerous. And your second point is just ridiculous. Tens of millions are living in poverty, and they are barely covered by benefits. Imagine if 50 million more people become unemployed and now will rely on the government for food and housing. Thats the real societal collapse, not a flu that kills the old and frail mostly. Sure the virus will cause many people to need to stay home just like during a regular flu, but after 1-2 weeks those people will have recovered and hopefully have immunity.  You and everyone else here are doing exactly what that guy warned against, which is to buy into the panic and act in stupid emotional ways. The only solution is the vaccine, and no country can stay locked down for more than 3 months.	1

"First of all, Kobe's death has nothing to do with difficulty running the league. Yes the China thing was difficult but the NBA as a whole, at least the way Silver has ""run"" it, is much easier. Let the players do whatever they want (i.e. constantly demanding trades) then lament about the players doing whatever they want, make a bunch of political PR statements and fans eat it up, your on-court product is terrible but fans don't care. That's what makes it the easiest league to run. Also the coronavirus decision wasn't a difficult decision, it was literally the only decision he could make. Every other American sports league just did the same thing, it isn't unique to him."	1

"Yeah fuck you too. The Yankees and Dodgers are in big markets (NY/LA) and are media darlings. You're only hearing about the Astros now cuz they beat  the Dodgers in the 2017 world series and the Yankees 2 of last 3 years in the ALCS including this year. So it's no coincidence the intial story from the Athletic just popped up out of nowhere during the World Series this year. Here ya go.  Here is the initial report from 2017 about the investigation:  >I have nonetheless concluded that during the 2017 season the Boston Red Sox violated the Regulation quoted above by sending electronic communications from their video replay room to an athletic trainer in the dugout.¬†  https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-rules-on-red-sox-yankees-sign-stealing-and-fines-both-teams/   Here is a recent article highlighting something that wasn't admitted in 2017:  >""Martino noted the Yankees did use their video room from 2015 to 2017 to decode signs, and MLB warned them and the Red Sox during the 2017 season that ""future violations of this type will be subject to more serious sanctions, including the possible loss of draft picks.""  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2871537-report-mlb-not-investigating-yankees-despite-old-alex-cora-carlos-beltran-video  And if you read the recent Manfred report you could find out that many teams already had their video rooms in their dugouts before the Astros got permission by the league tp move theirs to their dugout in 2018."	1

Lebrons teammates screwed him SO HARD at the end of that game. Here‚Äôs the final play made by every starter besides Lebron.  Kevin Love - On the play before the Hill free throws the Cavs are winning by 2. Kevin Love makes one of the most disgusting soft fouls ever. Probably the worst foul committed in the history of the Cavs franchise, given what it meant. Steph gets an EASY and 1 to put them up by 1. This foul was literally just as bad as the Ginobili v Dirk foul but nobody remembers it because of what else happened.  George Hill - next play Hill misses the FT. Now I‚Äôm not too mad about this because that‚Äôs fucking hard to do, making both free throws in that situation. Idc if it‚Äôs MJ, KD, Dirk, or anyone in between. Hitting free throws at the end of a finals game is Not easy. That being said he‚Äôs still an 80% FT shooter who missed.  JR Smith - didn‚Äôt know the score of the game somehow,, and then lied about it, also tried to point the finger at Lebron.  Tristan - tried to start a fight with Draymond  If Lebron didn‚Äôt know he was leaving,he knew after that. Literally every starter besides him did something retarded to end that game.	0

Isaiah Stewart I love, think he‚Äôs the type to have a 15 year career. High energy, does the little things, throws his body around (and others‚Äô) but plays with a great feel and has some decent skill. I‚Äôm surprised he‚Äôs fallen so low on mocks these days, you‚Äôd think his biggest worry is that he‚Äôs too short to play the 5 but the league is downsizing these days.  McDaniels tho I‚Äôm not a fan of and I usually love the tall skinny wings. I just don‚Äôt think he plays smart basketball at all, and it negates what skill he does he have. To play the type of way he perceives himself, he either has to get a lot more skilled or a lot smarter and I don‚Äôt think either happens. He can be a more than solid stretch 4 but it‚Äôll take some self-reflection or else he‚Äôll just bounce around a bunch of teams on the bench	0

Well considering that his offense fell off a cliff come playoff time, I don't really think those all defensive selections meant much when he could never get out of the first round with the Wolves - barring one year. It's like saying you'd rather have a worse scoring Kawhi Leonard than James Harden. 25ppg on 58TS is so much more valuable in the playoffs than an awful 18ppg on 52TS. Offense is always more impactful than defense. Always.	1

I sold Kelvin Benjamin Buffet Tickets   I figured it was a good time to share this story with the league being suspended. Might give someone a chuckle.   Also a much needed break from name and syllable rearrangement of player names.   I live in Chattanooga. Summer 2018 I was working at a convenience store near the discount Strip Club.   One night Kelvin literally walked in with 2 of his buddies. For whatever reason none of my coworkers and nobody in the busy store recognized him. He was peak incognito.   At first when he walked up to the counter my thoughts are the following.   Damn he‚Äôs big, big. Like BIG.   He has without a doubt raised the networth in this room by tens of cholesterol points.   I had to confirm it was him. Without appearing like a total creaming fanboy, I carefully scanned his hand.   Yes! It was a clogged artery. Holy Fuck!   Carotid artery also provided additional confirmation.   Kelvin has walked up to my register and is asking to purchase not one, not two, not 5 individual meals.   But 3 dozen buffet tickets. 5 plates come to one pack. That‚Äôs 180 PLATES.   3 Dozen! THAT IS EATING OLYMPICS RIGHT THERE.   Kel. Cause at this point in my mind we are buddies since our lives have taken drastically different turns to get to this one transaction.   He had a very very neat wallet. And for whatever reason, his wallet made the whole cashier section smell like high end smoked meats. Needless to say, thick people smell very very delicious.   He handed me a 10 100 dollar bills. I don‚Äôt remember what the exact amount was. But it was pretty close to 50 bucks worth of plates for that eating marathon he was gonna have.   Once I rang everything and handed him his plates. Time slowed down for a bit. Holy Fuck I‚Äôve interacted with a eating MVP.   I knew I only had this one chance. This one moment. This could be the last time I ever be in the same space as an NFL player.   I said the words that day that lead Kelvin Benjamin to have slightly more pep in his step.   I said with a chill down my spine and clench in my ass cheeks.   I said ‚ÄúHey. I like buttered crab legs‚Äù and he said Thanks and smiled.   Kelvin probably ate 25-30,000 calories that night. I gave the assist with the buffet. It was a good night.	1

So basically create a good team filled with veteran role players and stock up on assets to pull the trigger when a superstar becomes available.  Sounds like a good strategy, but I think there are so many ways to screw it up.  Just looking at the Pistons, they really don‚Äôt have any assets outside of Luke Kennard and wasted their one opportunity to stockpile some more by not trading Drummond earlier.  Also keep in mind it‚Äôs extremely difficult to win a championship in the NBA.  I‚Äôd say you need at least one top 5 and one top ten player and competent vets, or three players in the 10-15 range or better just to be in contention.  So even if the Pistons were getting a healthy peak performance Griffin, it still wouldn‚Äôt be enough.  Also the sixers were stacked with top end talent and still lost in round two (embiid, Butler, Simmons Harris are all in the 8-15 range).	0

"So it's more complicated than that, but I don't think the Nets should be blamed.  Basically the United States CDC decided to develop their own test. They did this because they didn't want to rely on the WHO test. Their initial problems generally stemmed from the fact China was refusing to ship virus specimen samples, so we had to get them from someplace else in the early days.  Then they fucked up the first test they created which basically meant they had to design a second one. They also had to throw out about 150,000 testing kits which had them on pace with what the WHO had developed at the time.  The problem is further compounded by the fact that the laboratory testing equipment the CDC and public laboratories have is sometimes different than that in most major research hospitals, which is generally different than that in most regional hospitals, and what is available in private labs is often a mixture. That is why you have different insurance networks in contact with different labs developing their own testing capabilities, so they can insure that their network has access to testing.   These things take time - it's not really a lack of resources. There is all the money they need and basically every lab that does this sort of thing, both public and private, are working on it.  So it's not just a matter of ""put money into increasing production,"" or ""buying them from abroad."" It's not like there is a plethora of equipment used for RNA extraction of samples just lying around, or a massive untapped manufacturing capability for that sort of specialized equipment.  But the reason I disagree with people casting this as ""rich versus poor"" is that diagnostic criteria for testing people is often going to involve behavior and the number of people that a subject would come into close contact with. Someone like an NBA player is at greater risk than your average Joe because they get swarmed by fans in public, not to mention they are effectively part of a population where n = 450 and public health officials know some of them are infected, so testing that whole population makes sense from a medical perspective."	0

Because hes the only threat we've ever seen at dethroning Jordan and its like the Trump effect. They picked Jordan as their guy so now anybody that threatens Jordans legacy is now an asshole in their eyes. Lebron has definitely made mistakes but they're at the level of another person just disliking him. Some of the pure raw hate he gets is way over the top especially if we're comparing the good he's done with his fuck ups	0

Birmingham is something like the 43rd biggest TV market in the country, and was the most consistent football TV market (i.e. highest rated) for 16 years in a row. It's a bigger media market than either Memphis or New Orleans, according to Nielsen.  Obviously there's no way to know if that would translate to NBA fandom. But again, there are no major pro sports teams in the market. So there wouldn't be any competition for eyeballs, once football is over.  As for metro size: https://moving.selfstorage.com/largest-metro-areas-without-major-league-sports-teams/  Top 10 isn't bad. Plus it's pretty clear Birmingham is the most sports-obsessed of any of that top 10.  I'm not saying it's a no brainer or anything. Obviously Seattle is the best candidate because the team is already wanted there. But Birmingham is a strong candidate for that second spot just because of the lack of competition by other non-football teams.	0

If you‚Äôre broke after making that much since October and are living paycheck to paycheck then you‚Äôre absolutely retarded  The minimum salary is $893,310 not $582,000 so my math is wrong.

I've been called a chink, had people glare at me for daring to be out in public getting groceries, and had people actively avoid me when they were completely fine talking to another non-Asian person beforehand. This was all in the past week and a half. I'm Korean but yeah, according to Reddit, calling it the Chinese Flu really takes it to China. What people don't understand is your average dumb motherfucker can't tell the difference between Asian people. We're all CCP spies to these assholes.  Reddit being openly racist to Asians is nothing new. I've dealt with this shit since I was a little kid. Most of the people on Reddit will never have to experience racism firsthand and thus have no empathy. It's honestly the harsh reality of this entire situation. But hey, you guys get to post fresh maymays shitting on Asians.	0

"> They had the opportunity to offer him an extension after the season and before free agency. They didn't.  Yeah, and as it clearly states in black and white the reason they didn‚Äôt offer a formal extension was because they were aware it wouldn‚Äôt make sense for him financially. They didn‚Äôt offer the extension because they knew it made more sense to him money-wise to wait for a bigger contract in the summer. Literally right there in English, but I understand reading comprehension isn‚Äôt really your strong suit.  In terms of this summer‚Äôs free agency, they didn‚Äôt offer him a contract because they knew he didn‚Äôt want to be there. It isn‚Äôt because they didn‚Äôt *want* him back. They just understood he‚Äôd rather be elsewhere. Not really that difficult to understand.  > Again, you don't know what ""facts"" mean. At all.

This isn‚Äôt about saying liberalism is definitively better than conservatism as a political philosophy, it‚Äôs about Donald Trump being an obvious and easily identifiable corrupt/selfish piece of shit as a human. Those who can‚Äôt look past their own political ideology to see a clear-cut example of a human parasite are never going to have their opinions validated just because ‚Äúeveryone has an opinion‚Äù.	0

The record and the championships don't say much. UCLA had won two consecutive championships before Kareem and then went on to win four straight the second he left. They were a ridiculously dominant team regardless of him and won multiple championships and rarely lost games without him.  Kareem is in the conversation, but to act like he is undeniably the GOAT is plain absurd... Go look at what Bird did in his three years at Indiana fucking State and you will understand why. Bill Walton also has a legitimate claim as the college basketball GOAT and so has Oscar Robertson.  So yeah, saying that calling anyone besides Kareem the GOAT is ridiculous actually is absolutely retarded.	0

He can follow the pj tucker move and learn to be a defensive minded player most who can shoot the ball well. But man I was shocked when I read nick nurses comment in regards to stanley at the start of the season this year. Nurse was targeting all of the new players including stanley   (https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2858387-raptors-nick-nurse-offers-critique-of-rondae-hollis-jefferson-stanley-johnson)  During this season ronde seemed to accept his role and learn the defensive schemes of the raptors, which resulted him to play more minutes. But stanley is a better defensive player than a offensive player, and he was criticized that badly by nurse. And never showed any improvement towards nurse that warranted stanley to play more. That shows you that during this season Nick nurse just gave up on Stanley in terms of playing him.	0

"This is what I don't get about this whining about the Raptors ""easy schedule"".  It isn't rocket science. There are more bad teams this year so of course there are more teams under 500. Look at everyone else during their last 15 games. Sure as shit they're going to be facing mostly teams under .500  With all these teams ""better than the Raptors"" also playing roughly the same amount of teams under .500 during this stretch, why don't all of them have the same kind of streak, if not more?  Also, what does it say going to the other side of this argument, that these superior teams are losing a lot more games to teams under .500? Must be a shitty team to keep losing to teams without a winning record.  This obsession with discrediting the Raptors streak right now is beyond pathetic. I find it even more funny considering the amount of injuries we have had. But go on, keep spreading this shit if that helps you feel comfortable about your team."	1

Wrong, I'm almost 40 so I grew up in the Jordan era and I'm very familiar with all the players and teams we're talking about. That 96 Supersonics team isn't beating the Warriors or Spurs teams that Lebron faced in any finals. That team was very good, but it wasn't historically great (they won a total of zero titles) - the Warriors and Spurs teams are. And yes Lebron would excel in any system, especially a Phil Jackson system, he's never played for a coach **remotely close** to the level of Phil.	1

"[https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/ezytd9/reasons\_that\_john\_paxson\_gar\_forman\_need\_to\_go/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/ezytd9/reasons_that_john_paxson_gar_forman_need_to_go/)  So without further ado, here are my reasons Garpax need to go:  In no particular order  * Cristiano Felicio Contract. He was 25 years old averaging 4 and 4. * Waiving Spencer Dinwiddie in favor of Michael Carter-Williams * Trading Tony Snell for Michael Carter-Williams * Letting Spencer Dinwiddie walk in favor of MCW * John Paxson choking Vinny Del Negro (His own hire), he would later be quoted ""What also disappointed me was that VDN never owned up to making a mistake"" * Fired Scott Skiles on Christmas Eve * Fired Bill Cartwright days after Thanksgiving after giving him mismatched rosters and under-preforming * Overruling This lobbying for Draymond Green to draft Marquis Teague * Refused or failed to take back salary and gather assets preferring to bet on player Development in Jabari Parker & Otto Porter JR * Tyrus Tomas for LaMarcus Aldridge * The biggest free agent signing of their tenure they almost immediately started drama with telling him he was no longer allowed to wear a headband. This policy would appear to be reverted years later w/ no explanation * Interviewed no one for the job of Head Coach but Jim Boylen & hired him. Worse several reporters (For example Vinny Goodwill) have alleged that this was like to have been planned since the summer beforehand. * Blindsided Hoiberg by firing him after showing up expecting to run practice. During his tenure here they fed him a steady stream of their personal projects & mandated them to receive playing time. None of these projects worked out. Examples are Jerian Grant, Cameron Payne, Joffrey Lavergne, Zipser, Felicio, etc. * Leaked that Derrick Rose was healthy to the media putting a ton of pressure on him to return in time for the playoffs & launching a wave of jokes that never really let up * Let Ron Adams go from Thibs Staff angering him & resulting in him going on to be the architect of the Warriors championship defense. He now has 3 rings. * Not trading Pau Gasol in 2015-16 where we would miss the playoffs and he would walk for nothing * Ran such a sloppy situation around Thibs firing that word reached Thibodeau Hoiberg would be his likely replacement while he was still coaching the team. Also serious speculation that this was told to players, undermining his authority as coach. * Thibs even being hired is a win for them right? No, they actually didn't want him. Tom Thibodeau was the recommendation of an outside group hired by Reinsdorf. John Paxson wanted Doug Collins and Gar Forman wanted Mike Brown. * Refused to hire Thibs strength & conditioning coach (Anthony Falsone) in Houston. He would later be hired and win the championship with the San Antonio Spurs in 2013-14. He still serves as their athletic director today. * Escorted Thibs out with security when he was fired. * Overpaid Fred Hoiberg 5 years /25 million and then fired him before it was complete. K.C. Johnson has speculated this is the reason why Jim Boylen remains. As, they don‚Äôt want to be paying two coaches not coaching at the same time. * Letting a lot of talent walk for nothing. To avoid the headache of having to defend each and every player in this group I‚Äôll make my case for the best and attach the rest as honorable mentions. Omer Asik is the biggest mistake. We had no backup 5 to replace him and Houston ended up getting an almost lottery pick for him later on so he was definitely moveable if we ever wanted out. Honorable mentions: Deng, Marco, E‚ÄôTwaun, the Bench mob. * Amnestied Carlos Boozer way too late to be able to matter * Leaked that Kris Dunn apparently wasn‚Äôt working hard enough over the summer * Failed to see the writing on the wall and instead of rebuilding committed us to that meaningless three alphas year just to do the same thing in the end. * The entire Doug McDermott situation can be made into like eight bullets and is stupidly controversial among Bulls fans. But I know there will be stans in the comments so I will let them defend Garpax. * Trading 17 & 18 for 11 in the 2013 draft  \*Using #11 to draft Doug Mcderrmott in a good draft.  * Dumping Doug Mcderrmott just two years later for basically nothing. * Were incredibly late to the game of analytics, frequently downplaying its importance. * Kevin O‚Äô Connor speculates that their promising to draft Chandler Hutchison restricted us from doing any draft night trades involving the #22 pick in 2018. Started our rebuild by selling a second- round pick. (We know Jordan Bell isn‚Äôt good, that‚Äôs never what this was about) * Third largest market in the NBA, paid the luxury tax twice. Traded for OPJ whose making 27 million and has played in 24/78 games available. If his girlfriend is reliable he‚Äôs also not a fan of the front office and a free agent in a year. * Horrible medical team. We‚Äôre always injured every single year. * Rosters frequently have big holes and they take bizarre steps to fix them. No Small Forward? Jabari. Need a long-term scoring option next to Rose? 33-year-old Rip Hamilton seems like a safe bet. (I love Rip but that doesn‚Äôt make it a good signing) Need a solid starting ball-handler & playmaker? Tomas Satorasnky, MCW, Jerian, Rondo seems like the wait maybe nvm. I know that you can‚Äôt nail every signing and not even all of these are bad. It‚Äôs more that there seems to be consistent gaps between how they evaluate talent & fit and that actually translates to the court. * 5 Playoff Series wins total in a 17-year tenure. * Had a Bulls doctor question Luol Deng about sitting out of games for a broken leg. * Dumped John Salmons and a first & second round pick to chase Lebron and ended up with nothing. * Trading Kirk Hinrich during his farewell tour for basically nothing. * Again, overruling Thibs when he liked Rudy Gobert for Tony Snell * Pulled the QO on David Nwaba for Jabari Parker. I feel like Nwaba while maybe not fantastic on his own fit really well with us. We‚Äôve been a worse team since he left. * Misused Lauri basically his entire time here. Maybe not directly because of this but it‚Äôs now being rumored that he wants out. * Traded Taj Gibson in a year we made the playoffs for Cameron Payne & Joffrey Lavergne. * Failing to net any assets at the 2020 trade deadline. * IMO have had serious questions regarding their drafting ability since now Orlando Magic assistant GM left in 2012. * Are alleged to use the media to trash players and coaches by [Van Gundy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I4Y4VyDqrs)  ETA: - Dwade contract  * Couldn't build around Jimmy * Bad player development, everyone is regressing save Zach * Had coaches spy on coaches/players (Randy Brown) * Failed to make Chicago a FA destination * Inherited the prestige Jordan gave us, made us a joke. * Threatening to give Jimmy Butlers minutes to Tony Snell when he refused a contract extension."	0

I'm gonna have a really hot take and expect to be downvoted but where was the panic and the outcry when the swine flu infected 60 million Americans and over 700+ million people worldwide in 2009-10? Where was the suspended seasons due to SARS, Ebola, bird flu, Zika,etc? Yes, I get it. There's no vaccine for COVID-19 but vaccines only help you get better if you get sick, it doesn't prevent you from getting it. The common flu is also more contagious than coronavirus. SARS is twice as contagious and no one here batted an eye when there was a SARS outbreak.  The vast majority of people that have died from COVID-19 are the same at-risk people for regular flu, ie elderly and people with compromised immune and respiratory systems. The weather is going to get warmer in a couple of months and you'll see this virus slowly die out and everything will be back to normal by summer. Count on it. It's a virus. It's not the second coming of the black plague. Take precautions, be safe, and everything will be alright.	1

"""His fans are the most annoying people on the planet""  LOL someone's clearly never been an NBA fan during 2008-2010 when Kobe fans were the most obnoxious douchebags ever. They shit on LeBron any chance they get, shit on the Celtics and whine and fight with every other fanbase. Fuck, here in Toronto, there were so many bandwagon Laker fans/Kobe fans who weren't true to the raptors it was annoying as fuck.  Then they became those annoying warriors bandwagons in 2015 who continue to shit on LeBron.  Where do you see these so called ""annoying LeBron fans""? If they shit on Curry or KD it's only because those fans are attacking him like they have for the past 10 years."	0

"Oh come on, the comment I responded to about funding for military but not for health is obviously a jab at conservative spending in general, healthcare (either socialized or ACA), or the CDC budget (or even all three). I then try as hard as possible to limit the scope of the argument to my point, that funding had not been cut (which it hasn't), then get told I'm wrong (which I'm not) while being told I'm straw-manning (how?).  I feel like most people think the response has been poor, but [Democrats literally wanted Trump to end the travel ban and thought it was overreaching](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/11/democrat-response-to-coronavirus-end-trumps-travel-bans-on-china-iran/) and [called it racist](https://www.wnd.com/2020/02/democrats-call-trumps-expansion-travel-ban-racist/), while actively trying to resist it. Coronavirus hasn't gotten anywhere as bad as H1N1 yet and I don't think depression-inducing panic is going to solve anything. Neither does appealing to some moral authority and politicizing a topic where, you personally should want good leadership and a calm attitude.  Trump has already tried to appropriately seek funding meanwhile Nancy Pelosi had the United States senate on lock from the middle of January into February, and then again when a coronavirus bill was trying to be passed she tried to sneak in a Hyde amendment exception [source](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/sasse-rips-pelosi-for-trying-to-smuggle-hyde-amendment-loophole-into-coronavirus-package/).

This guy is a pure hater but i get it. It must be hard watching him raw dog your team in the playoffs. Curry is the reason Harden doesnt have a ring.. Saying he didnt change anything is false. People  were skeptical about shooting 3s because analysts like charles barkley got them believing that no jump shooting team could win a title. Curry's success winning  shooting jumpshots was a validation and it blew up.   Lets address curry getting carried by his team mates. Tell me now that draymond would have been an all star if he played with harden, westbrook, cp3 ,lebron or any other elite player. Draymond'soffensive game relies on curry getting double teamed. Klay is a 41.9% 3pt shooter for his career. When curry leaves the floor, data has shown that percentage to drop to 38%. Have u ever seen klay get double teamed?. Klay is a great player but he still doesnt know how to split a double team till today because curry get all the attention. 2019 finals curry got double teamed, triple teamed, boxed and 1 while klay had single coverage on lowry who he just posted up all series. Warriors never lost because curry choked. They lost because nobody else stepped up. Curry averaged 30ppg in the finals. More than kwahi's 28ppg but raptors had 6 players that averaged double figures in that finals while warriors had just 3. Klay 26ppg and draymond 11ppg.. Tell me what iguodala and livingston achieved before joining the warriors.       Kd was known as MR Unreliable in okc because his efficiency reduced drastcally in the post season. Now he went to golden state and his efficiency skyrocketed. Kd had the most efficient years of his playoff career at golden state. Recorded his highest FG% with the warriors. Data also showed that kd became less efficient with curry off the floor. Which is why they were barely above 500 with kd and no Curry.   Curry became an allstar and an all nba player before steve kerr got there despite being snubbed a year prior. Draymond was still a bench player when curry became an all star and klay wasnt this Klay.  Im trying to understand where your notion of getting carried by team mates came from. Steph has averaged more ppg than all those team mates except kd in every season and every playoff. And dont forget he beat kd fair and square in 2016 playoffs..   Lets address the elite playmaking issue. Curry was averaging 8.5assists per game under mark jackson when he was a ball dominant guard. Steve kerr convinced him to get off ball more for the team to be more unpredictable which he did. Even Doc rivers mentioned this in a press conference. Curry is selfless and doesnt play for stats which is why they always win.Can anyone tell CP3 to give up the ball? 75% of Draymond's assists are hockey assists of curry's passes and he doesnt care. Look at the 2018 houston series, games 5, 6 and 7 curry was posting 8 and 9 apg because kerr made him ball dominant when the series was about to slip away.         Lets talk about handles. Curry's handles are elite and very efficient. He used to do elaborate handles back in the days but rarely does them now because its better to driblle less while other shooters go cold.Curry and kd had identical usage in their 3yrs together. Kd never had usage close to westbrook in any season they played together. Kyrie has better handles agreed but he prefers to dribble around while shooters go cold. You have to be living under a rock not to know that kyrie's presence has never made any team better. Tatum regressed last year because of kyrie and dinwiddle is up for a down year next year when kyrie returns.. Harden doesnt have better handles than curry. Curry handles in motion while harden dribbles life out of the shot clock at one spot..  Replace harden with curry on that rockets team and i swear  they have more success.Curry makes his teammmates better than harden can ever imagine..	0

I'd take prime Kawhi over a prime Wade.     From 2004-2010, during Wade's prime solo years before the Big 3, the Miami Heat averaged 43 wins a season.      Granted Wade missed about 30 and 20 games two of those seasons, but the Heat really should have a better average record than 43-39.  &#x200B;  Kawhi somehow has that X-factor that translates to championship contender, in his unassuming manner. Spurs were up by 20 against the Warriors because Zaza-pacheapshot. Raptors won a championship, and Clips are in contention too now.	0

Harden is a waaaaaaaaaay better offensive player, DWade had moves but he was a very limited shooter, got the line, but had a bad FT shooting for a guard.   Harden is also very underrated defensively. Nevertheless, Wade is better defensively overall and on his prime he was DPOY-level in 08/09 after Beijing, but the most important thing is that he is much more consistent overall.   So until consistency matters it‚Äôs even, when it matters throughout tough playoff series when you can‚Äôt fall below your level on every single night, it‚Äôs advantage to DWade which is crucial.	0

> but I'd give the benefit of the doubt to the guy running the best offense of all time  Not knocking Dallas because they are good, but they aren't even the best offense this year, in any category, how can they be the best offense of all time?  ninja: unless you are just talking about Ortg? I think that is not a good measurement personally (due to overall changes in league play, but fair enough.  another edit to doubly make sure I am clear:  ORTG is a great stat, I just don't think it is good to try and compare teams over different eras. The Mavs have a pace of ~98.something, which is like 5th best this year, with the Houston and MIL both having a much higher pace on slightly lower efficiency. '82 Nuggets is like the perfect example of the mixture of pace and efficiency. They put up 600 more points than the second most points of all time. If they had any semblance of a defense, they may have never lost, lol.	1

CCP definitely has their problems, suppression of free speech, etc but non related to COVID19.  &nbsp;  Most Countries (including USA, Canada, Italy, etc), squandered time that they had to act.  Taiwan/Singapore has done a great job according to news articles.  &nbsp;  Some moot points that people brought up with respect to how other countries have responded.  1. China suppressed the Doctor that raised awareness about this. True, this was done at a state level. People have been fired for the suppression. The suppression doesn't affect the time other countries have wasted. 1. China is under reporting numbers. True, but so is every one else. The lack of testing capacity, and the virus being new affected this. We saw (in Feb) how fast this spread in China & the drastic measures they took to curb the spread but other countries just sat idle.   Unclear points against China.  1. Wave 2 numbers are unclear.  Clear points against China  1. The prevention of WHO to give information to Taiwan  This by no means is a complete list of points.  That being said, we need to be careful about the 2nd wave of Corona virus.	0

Unfortunately, no matter how hard a person might *consciously* try to treat every person the same way and avoid prejudice based on appearance, it's impossible to avoid feeling what's been embedded into one's subconscious mind. News, advertisements, films, tv, etc all have a hand in scultping the way we frame the world, and it's difficult to undo all that, all the time. Acknowledging the existence of these *implicit biases* is a great first  step towards undoing them.	0

You use curse words, you are grounded.. He said his dad was very humble and down to earth and all he did is emulate his dad. His dad was a role player. Curry is basically a superstar with a role player's humility. Thats why he doesnt get angry when the wild animal draymond is barking at him.

It‚Äôs not fake. But it‚Äôs demonstrably a microscopic deal compared to the flu.  China has less than a quarter as many active cases as they had 3-4 weeks ago. They‚Äôre going to end up around 6000 casualties.  Compared to 400,000 to 800,000 flu deaths they‚Äôll have this year.  How are people freaking out about this ???  I live 5km from the Italian border.  Right now, there are about 1/500th as many infected Italians with coronavirus as there are with the flu. 1/500th.  Even if you go by the alarmist estimates of COVID being 10 times as deadly and 3 times as infectious, I‚Äôm still 17 times more likely to catch the flu and die from it if I go to Italy right now as I would be to catch corona and die from that.  I‚Äôll bet ANYONE willing right here, any amount of money they want, that the total confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US won‚Äôt reach 300,000.

>Yeah because Wade is sooo much better at 2s than Harden that's why he misses more shots.   I mentioned 2 specific ways to get 2pt shots. A single percentage that encapsulates the entire area inside the 3pt line isn't telling you how someone scores directly at the rim or in the post.   >Lmao did you ever watch the Heatles? 80% of their offense was iso Wade or LeBron. I remember seeing stats where them and Bosh put up like 90% of the Heats points every year.   Exactly. LeBron AND Wade. He was sharing those duties with another ball dominant player. Not to mention his usage never even touched Harden's over the past 3 years.   >What's not to get? A good portion of Wade's career was just driving to the rack and flopping to go to the line.  It's obvious you don't know what you're talking about lmao. He was able to score out of the PnR, in post ups, from mid range either off a step back or a pull up, he had floaters, and he was a great off ball cutter. Not having a 3pt shot doesn't make someone one dimensional.   >Do you have any actual stats to support Wade is better offensively than Harden?  Obviously not because you're skewed to Harden's last 3 years where the Rockets were running one of the most iso heavy offenses ever.   >Or are you just going to write off all mine with your biased fanboyism?  It's not fanboyism to point out your lack of knowledge.	1

You can't compare US to Europe (or Euroleague) fans actually and it is not about freedom of speech. The difference is, if an owner of a Euroleague team would act like this (doesn't give a shit about team) fans would just **tell him to go KYS and STOP going to games**. Dolan's advantage is that **people do actually STILL go to games=CASH FLOW** (i guess to watch enemy teams/stars?). At Europe's culture each team has an organized fans' club (unofficially connected to team)  that follows the team (when they play away) and act like soccer hooligans.   Also vast majority of NBA fans are actually about the star player and not the team they watch.

Why do people continue to insist Jokic is out of shape? Granted the guy is a big guy and he starts out slow then absolutely takes over the game. Jokic is a superstar, his numbers continue to prove it. Averaging 20/10/7 on over 50 percent shooting. I think Denver would have been a real threat to win the west if this was the NBA ten years ago.	0

76ers fan here I'm not sure what the average salary for the league's top 100 executives is but I'm assuming it's in the six figures. there's a sizable difference between loosing 20% of 200k and giving life a go making 160k vs. loosing 20% making 50k like our jackass owner planned and keeping a roof and food on the table for the family. Im cool if it's limited to the top 100 exec's.	0

I see what you're saying. On the face of it, all of Kobe's awards look one-sided vs Hakeem's individual awards.   Context matters, though: one year, the dream pulled a Dirk before Dirk, meaning he won with only role players. The next, his best teammate was acquired by a mid-season trade that saw the former 2nd best quit on the team (Maxwell) during the playoffs, and Drexel was then at the end of his peak years.  On the other hand, I think it matters significantly that Kobe played with prime Shaq, then had the freakishly skilful, long bois in Pau (arguably the most one-sided trade in history at the time), Bynum, and Odom.  Long story short, Hakeem did waaaay more carrying that Kobe ever had to, and that elevates him above Kobe in my admittedly biased opinion. If just looking at accolades, I think he joins Jordan and Kawhi as the first to win MVP, FMVP, and DPOY the same year. And one year he should have won over Robinson, was robbed, then took it very personally in their playoff match up. People forget he's top 10 in steals and number one in blocks, so arguably the most unique and versatile defender the game has seen as well.  That's my case, but it's a debate.	0
Fucking watch the games donkey. Shaq couldnt guard Hakeem. Hes getting fouled out 4 quarter. Just watch the games like dumb fucks like you make me angry stats doesnt tell you the whole truth. You look at adrien dantleys stats and hes the og KD. Hes not he chokes the ball at reality. Hakeem not requiring any one else to defend Shaq is the focal point of this arguement. Hakeem made his team better. And they had pretty similar teams and you could argue that Magic was better.	0

He touched his head. I don't care how tall Tacko is, if you set up a goal and can't clear it, it's not a perfect score dunk.   In general there is a huge score inflation and a ton of dunks got in the 47-50 range which is stupid, because then the truly great dunks are under scored. If the dunks were put on a more realistic scale, I don't think it's a 50 point dunk.  edit: I think this is the first time I've seen a 100+ point comment marked as controversial. Am I more divisive than Trump? Let's find out.	1

Something like this was posted last night, and again people are calling him evil when they have zero understanding of what is going on.  Since I‚Äôm quarantined and have nothing to do I‚Äôll explain this for everyone:  Depending on the state, servers make anywhere from tipped minimum wage to regular minimum wage, same with bussers. Hosts/hostesses/kitchen employees make minimum wage to that plus a few bucks.  On a typical night, Morton‚Äôs (A Landry‚Äôs restaurant) staffs like this:   12 Servers/Bartenders @ 3.63 per hour. Average of 7 hours worked each= $305  6 Backservers/Barbacks @ 5.50 per hour. Average of 6 hours worked each= $198   3 Hosts @ 12.75 per hour. Avg 5 hours= $191  12 Kitchen Employees @ 15 per hour 7 hours worked each= $1260  So on my low staffing estimate we have just under $2000 per day. This is without adjusting the pay to meet the minimum wage, which would have to happen for tipped employees because obviously they aren‚Äôt getting tips right now.   Even without that adjustment, over his 500+ restaurants Fertitta would be spending $1000000 a day just on paying his hourly employees their hourly rate. There are plenty of other operating costs on top of this.  These employees are eligible for unemployment. Sure it‚Äôs not what they normally make but it‚Äôs enough to get by with the bare minimum. I would know I‚Äôm doing it right now.  Any questions? I have a nap scheduled for 3 but besides that my day is pretty wide open	1
I don't want to advocate for actual hurting anyone but the reality is that people are not physical enough him and they should foul him hard enough and he stops pretending that he's being fouled because he's actually being fouled. Like, if you know that the guy is trying retard shit on you... drop him on the floor when he tries to lay on your back. He won't want to do it again. It's not about hurting him, but if you're mcw as far as I am concerned he was trying to hurt you.	0

Rookie Scottie in the playoffs averaged 26 minutes in there 3-2 win in the first round. I never said Scottie was better as a rookie, than cj is now. More so I‚Äôm talking about team fit not individual talent. The bulls needed someone who could raise their overall defense to elite, given mjs dominance in volume on offense and defense. Pippen provided that bump at the time. CJ alone doesn‚Äôt raise the teams at both ends in the same way. With MJ, they didn‚Äôt need a lot pieces to compete, but they still needed pieces.	1

I don't get why people think guy is some lowkey douche. I remember watching a player tribune video and guy seemed like a very well-spoken and geniune dude. Maybe he has faults and could seem immature but it doesn't seem he is some POS person. It's why I laugh at the arrogant Jimmy Butler fanboys thinking KAT is not some good hearted person. I really feel bad for his loss man.  I'm done with people being entitled in America. It's not just about taking things seriosuly but just understnading the situation. Many people complain about how much these lockdowns are hurting many people and I aree. We can't expect to lockdown America for so long, but we need to get people hve already and can be affected by this and it's not good. It's why I wish people just stopped panicking like the babies in r/coronovirus making everything seemed like the end of the world and people at /unpopularopinion saying this virus is a joke and that everything should cater ot people who won't bve affected and going to malllies and getting dollies for my baby girl is more important.    That's to any conservativesliving in POS joke states like Alabmama, Florida, Texas, and whatever white KK hotspots GO FUCK YOURSELF. This applies to you baby insecure SJWs living in California. If oyu don't like republicnas or democrats just don't ever go these states or care about them. I'm never going to shitty states that have KKK activity like georgia or North Carolina cause I know there will be some sort of racism so I don't give a fuck.   I don't care if KAT is a celebrity, his mother fuckin died and seemed like a average American. Fuck America at times. Hope people just take things seriosuly and just look towards getting things done SOON. We could possibly get this under control, we should always have faith. The season can literally restart in 2020. But just do THINGS NOW. Americans are super entitled and the reason why KAT mothers died is because AMerica will never be united. America's culture is like a thrid world country tbh. It's honestly sad. Feel bad for good Americans like me but many want to play poltiics.	0

Danny Green‚Äôs salary this year is $14,634,147.  Players typically get paid biweekly. The regular season is about 6 months. Danny Green makes a cool half mil every two weeks if paid only during the regular season, or .5mil/month if spread out year round.   I like Danny Green, but damn.  That‚Äôs so much money.   That‚Äôs over $40k/day.   It‚Äôs hard for me to feel a lot of sympathy for him when he makes more money in a day than a solid 1/3 of American households make in a year.    Unless we‚Äôre talking G-League-(who make $35k for their 5 month season), these guys should have plenty of money.	0

First, I remember healthcare prior to Obama. You're right that healthcare has been free market in America for a long time. But never before has it been so closely tied to employment where almost all large employers are forced to provide healthcare for full time employees. It fucked up a lot of people's lives and is part of why so many people have to have two jobs now.  At a place I managed we used to have full time hourly employees just out of high school. But with Obamacare we cut all their hours to less than 28 per week to avoid having to provide healthcare for them.   Any full time employees and their employers immediately starting paying premiums for ALL employees. This immediately added billions of dollars in premiums to the corporations controlling health insurance.  It also forced many companies to cut hours so much that people who were making a living before were completely screwed.  And a healthy person used to be able to choose rather they wanted to pay out of pocket for a yearly checkup or pay for insurance. It's cheaper to just pay out of pocket for one yearly visit if you are lucky enough to stay healthy.   Health insurance is supposed to be used for risk mitigation. If you're low risk then why should you be forced to pay exorbitant premiums???   Plus, those premiums are not on a case by case basis. If they were healthy young 20 year old would pay very little in insurance costs. As it is young employees on a company provided healthcare plan pay the same as a 40 year old or 50 year old employee, meaning they're paying for some of the burden and risk of the older employees with no choice to drop out.  Not to mention how many services aren't covered by insurance plans and how insane your deductibles can be. On many you have to pay 5k out of pocket for hospital services before anything is even covered by the plan you pay for, and thats assuming you are in the right network and seen by the right doctors and the procedures are ultimately deemed necessary and are covered by the insurance company and plan you have.  Second, your second paragraph agrees with what I said.   But I think our healthcare costs are artificially propped up partially because there is no mediator. The government providing healthcare would allow them to leverage mass purchasing of supplies and medicine and also control market costs of critical medical supplies.

This is why this sub will never be a viable place for analysis of basketball. People want to scream and bitch in their comments everytime the team they hates benefits. The fact no one wants to mention Theiss constantly hooking AD under the basket or the tick tacky fouls that brought the Celtics into the game says everything. Both teams had a missed goaltend. The JB call was bullshit. Just because only the bad calls are being posted for one team doesn't tell the story of the full 48 minutes. Anyone that understands basketball and watched 48 minutes would undoubtedly know that this game was in no way decided by referees.	1

Now that's actually a good question! I would argue that Trump failed to put the right people in charge. Those people failed to set proper expectations with the leaders of specific departments, namely ones that were keeping track of the spread of COVID-19. Those departments probably have about 5 or 6 layers of management before you get to the people with actual boots on the ground. Those people have probably been with the agency for 10-20 years and never thought COVID would get this crazy, and there's 10,000 policies and procedures for reporting to upper management, so the feedback loop from top to bottom of the organization was bad. Compound that with Trump saying it's not a big deal and you've got a cluster on your hands.   1. Setting the wrong people in charge was Trumps fault.   2. Having poor bureaucracy from people actually doing the work in the agency is a systemic problem with any public organization worth billions of dollars.	1

I think he did experience racism, but then it got to the point where people were saying all of his struggles were due to 'racism.'  Those news articles like the 'chink in the armor' and 'women in NYC about to feel couple of inches of pleasure tonight' were absurdly racist. And honestly he probably got profiled every time he was asked to show his credentials when he was walking into the stadium with teammates.  But then you got people saying the reason he's not in the league anymore was because of racism, and that the refs were racist towards him	1

Actual legal answer.  No.     This is defined as subterfuge.  The act of using deceit in order to achieve a goal.  This applies to all sort of legal issues.  For example you buy a car for $6,000.

Or you are from a country that has been destroyed by interventionist US foreign policy. Or you want to have a future where the planet is not a burning husk of rubble.

Or you're a gay man in Greece or Rome, or a woman in a pre-neolithic society.  See? The woke narrative really only applies to America, starting around the turn of the century.

I mean I get what PG is talking about. It's a different culture in LA because he was revered as a diety here. He really was the face of our city in a way not even Jeter or Magic or any sports legend from here can compare to. But that doesnt mean other people didn't share that love. PG is just saying that for us Kobe Bryant was part of our daily lives, from conversation to conversation, even after he retired. The lot of us were crying over his retirement lamenting that basketball would never be the same. But again, Kobe was an influence for many people and deeply loved all over, so I can understand why people would be thinking he's gatekeeping grief. I get where he's coming from though.	1

"I think you're kinda re-writing history.  Out of all the guys you mentioned in the east, ""Jason Kidd, Vince Carter, Antwan Jamison, Caron Butler, Chris Weber, Rasheed Wallace,  Richard Jefferson"" only one of them (Chauncey Billups) made all NBA (3rd team).  The East sucked that year.  The number 1 seeded Pistons were old and only won 53 games.  The top 3 seeds in the West won more games than that.  The fearsome Nets you're talking about finished 41-41.  They were a 6 seed and barely 500.  The Spurs barely escaped a 7 game series with the Suns after some controversial suspensions and then swept the Cavs in a series where it never really felt like the Cavs had a chance.  The East was absolutely weak compared to the West that year.  Lebron was amazing, but the argument that he had a tough road to the finals that year is bullshit."	0

Jordan's legacy would somehow be less if he made it to the Finals in 95 and lost to Hakeem rather than bowing out in the Semi's to the Magic like he did. It is absolutely retarded that losing in the Finals is more of a hit on you're legacy than losing in the earlier rounds! Has no one ever questioned how actually stupid this thinking is? If I could chose Everton getting to 3 F.A Cup Finals in a row and winning them all or getting to 7 in a row and winning 4 of them, I know which one I am picking without fucking hesitation mate! Yerrr... We may have lost 3 of them Finals but overall we won 4 and got to 7 straight Cup Finals rather than not even making it to the Final. Don't let this retarded media agenda fool you.	0

Yes I still play baskerball and I know its not the smartest thing to do, but I have taken other protective measures and drastically decreased the amount of people I come into contact on a daily basis. Of the very few people I do now interact with, all are informed that I play basketball and it is their fault and responsibility for putting themselves at risk.  No I never stated that me playing basketball will help flatten the curve.  Yes, the amount of *active* cases will be higher if we didn't quarentine, but about the same total amount of people will end up having gotten infected.  Pull up any flatten the curve graph and they will all show you that more quarentine and social distancing will only increase the total duration of this pandemic which was my whole point in the first place.	0

Then like my franchise he continues to deteriorate at a snail's pace with the incompetent fucks he brings in to fix things lacking the wisdom to do anything other than make them worse.  He's lived a lavish lifestyle of gluttony and greed, spent more money without a second thought on whether he could afford it than any of us put together will likely ever earn in our lifetimes and treated his workers like he treats the team he owns, like trash  If this virus is going to take so many undeserving then it better take at least one person that does, and I can think of parasite on God's green Earth more deserving than James fucking Dolan  Edit: Hahahaha 13 MINUTES LATER I GOT THE BAN, THAT'S GOTTA BE SOME SORT OF RECORD	0

>CDC estimates 80% of the country gets this thing before it's over. That's 256 million people. 2% of that is over 5 million  This is a huge distortion. The range I've read is from 40% to 70%, and the vast majority of cases are mild (80%).  You do a huge disservice by automatically projecting the worst case scenario.  If Italy is the worse case, the avg age of those that died is in the 80s.   People *need* to go back to work. Millions live paycheck to paycheck - they cannot just not work. Unrest can lead to looting and violence, which can also overload the system.  Again, you have very little life experience to understand the downstream effects. Your view is myopic - you only understand the hysteria in front of you, and you immediately jump to the worst case scenario *as your base case*. A complete fallacy.	0

"> No they don't lol, you don't know what you're talking about  No 5 footers in the last All Star game.   Isaiah Thomas the hero of manlets has already been kicked out of the NBA for being shit.  > Jokic is one of the best passers in the league, leads the league in game winners, and is already the best passing center of all time.  There are 3 billion 5 footers in the world and you are going to tell me that not a single one of them is better than that bum?  Very easy to pass the ball when you see everyone from above and it's hard as fuck to block you because you are 7 foot tall.  >  Thon Maker is a good example. He is athletic and is said to have a great work ethic by everyone, but he's mediocre.  Quick Google search: ""When he was 14, Maker was discovered by Edward Smith...   At first, Maker was reluctant to leave the soccer field behind to focus on organized basketball... At that time Thon was spending his time playing soccer, and had never played basketball a day in his life.""  ""I said no, not because of him, but just I didn‚Äôt want to play basketball,"" Maker explained. ""But after trusting in him and going along with the plan, he said, 'Trust me, trust me.'""   Another case of a Soccer reject being told to pursue a Basketball career because Basketball is easy money for very tall dudes... Holy shit there are many many cases of lazy very tall people choosing Basketball for easy money.  Thon Maker is a lazy dude, he couldn't make it in soccer, a sport where you can make a decent living in thousands of teams (each team has like 22 players)... Yet, he quit and switched to Basketball at the age of 14 and is earning millions in the NBA already even if he doesn't give a fuck about the sport.  > The reason the other antetokounmpo brothers have contracts is so teams can lure in Giannis.  The NBA is the dumbest shit ever haha.  > By the way, Giannis is known for having a crazy work ethic lol.  A European Soccer reject has crazy work ethic... Holy shit, if you think a bum like him has work ethic then that explains why the US sucks at European sports like Rugby and Soccer. You have no idea what work ethic means mate.  > you also need to understand that even soccer players require a lot of natural talent. Every single sport requires natural talent and athleticism to compete at the top. Messi is insanely quick and coordinated. Ronaldo is one of the most athletic guys on the planet. Basketball isn't much different.  That's insulting, you will never see rejects form other sports making it to the top of Soccer, let alone reject from other sports that were developed by countries with no soccer infrastructure.  Messi and Ronaldo started to play Soccer at age 4 and worked their assess off, they left their families behind at the age of 11 to go the Barcelona academy (Messi) and Sporting Lisbon (Ronaldo), that's work ethic... They are at the top because of hard work, Messi and Ronaldo are not gifted athletes, Messi looks like a retard and Ronaldo looked like this at the age of 18 [before and after](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/huUuBVRPTKk/maxresdefault.jpg)  It's insulting to compare Giannis, a soccer reject who switched to Basketball late in life to make easy money with Messi and Ronaldo, the hardest workers in sports.  Basketball is based on being tall, sports like soccer are based on hard work, skills and sports IQ."	0

Yes I did. The majority of assist leaders are ball hogs who eat up clock. One of the reasons people thought the Harden and CP3 Rockets weren't gonna work out was because it was two ball dominant guards on the same team.

Hispanics lag 5%.  Blacks by 11%.  Yeah, we predominantly see white faces as the front of the anti gay movement, but remember, we live in America and that is who has the loudest and largest voice. Rich, white, Male, Christian.  One also might wonder how things like age, education, income may figure in to the numbers.  Would they causes statistical skew and error?

Because you're equating regular season stats with finals. It's disingenuous to assume a player will replicate their regular season stats in the playoffs and especially the Finals. He averaged 24 his first MVP season so your point is garbage anyway.   Curry has always been a high turnover player. Him playing recklessly is what makes his game a huge tradeoff between explosive plays and devastating mistakes. Calling that out as if it's a singular event is also disingenuous.   Lastly, assists are only counted if the player makes the shot. Using that as a metric without looking at how bad everyone else played is also nonsense. Go back and watch how many open shots were whiffed by Barnes, Iggy, and Thompson.   Everyone played down. Curry wasn't great, but saying he massively choked is a straight up delusional argument. You're looking for some kind of legitimate excuse to hate on him when the truth is there isn't really. This is painfully obvious by the fact your initial reasoning for hating on Curry is that he threw his mouthpiece. If you want to hate, go ahead. But don't act like your reasons come from anything based in reality.	0

Hakeem gets shortchanged for things that were beyond his control. Wasn't his fault that Ralph Sampson broke down and it took the Rockets brass over a half decade to give him a decent supporting cast.

[Because the Trump administration failed us. ](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/06/coronavirus-testing-failure-123166)   Edit: Apologies. This link appears to be outdated info. Per the comment below from u/terp_on_reddit, I did some quick research and he appears to be correct.   The Trump administration still failed us, though.   [The administration has implied the WHO test isn‚Äôt accurate enough,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/health/coronavirus-tests-who.html) which is not correct.   [Here‚Äôs a more recent article from ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-south-korea-scaled-coronavirus-testing-while-the-us-fell-dangerously-behind) contrasting the difference between America‚Äôs and South Korea‚Äôs responses:   The contrast to the United States, which tested a few thousand people in the weeks when health experts say the outbreak was spreading across this country, could not be more stark. Instead of using the template approved by the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention set out to create its own test from scratch, only to see that effort plagued by delay and dysfunction that continues to this day.  America‚Äôs inability to know who is infected has broad implications. It means that infected people have wandered through offices, buses, restaurants, emergency rooms and malls, indiscriminately spreading the virus.  Edit 2: One more addition since this is getting views.   Never forget that it never had to be as bad as it‚Äôs going to get.    Washington Post editorial: [I ran the White House pandemic office. Trump closed it. ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/nsc-pandemic-office-trump-closed/2020/03/13/a70de09c-6491-11ea-acca-80c22bbee96f_story.html)   ‚ÄúWhen President Trump took office in 2017, the White House‚Äôs National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense survived the transition intact. Its mission was the same as when I was asked to lead the office, established after the Ebola epidemic of 2014: to do everything possible within the vast powers and resources of the U.S. government to prepare for the next disease outbreak and prevent it from becoming an epidemic or pandemic.   One year later, I was mystified when the White House dissolved the office, leaving the country less prepared for pandemics like covid-19.‚Äù	1

The maximum threshold for receiving a check for a married couple is $199,000 MAGI on the last tax return submitted. The league-minimum is $582,000.  Now the G-league players are most likely eligible, since they receive a minimum $7,000 per month or $35,000 for the 5-month season.	0

You're 100% right on the point of there being a big gap between the LGB and the T lol, it's something that gets discussed a lot within the lgbt community as well. In the loosest possible sense, transitioning simply means undergoing changes to better accommodate your gender identity rather than the identity you were assigned at birth - whether this takes the form of something as simple as a different name and pronouns or something as complicated as sex reassignment surgery and HRT.   Your original comment was fine, if i'm honest i took more of an issue with your second reply, which came across a bit more victim complex-y. The majority of the time if lgbt people say that you've done or said something bigoted towards lgbt individuals or the community, they probably aren't just saying it for fun. Now I can clearly tell you're pretty open minded and reasonable given that you're engaging in this discussion in good faith, so just listening to why they say that or accepting that you might have done something offensive and trying to change for the next time is the best way to deal with that situation. Sometimes it's as simple as just 'we live this, we know about our circumstances better, so please don't speak over us on the topic' you know?	1

"He's taking what the guy said in the top comment - ""ITT a bunch of people who have never hooped"" - and ratcheting it up to 11.  Nothing in his comment is even talking about fouling.  It's just laughably stereotypical blustering about how great he was in high school.  And that's the point.  He's mocking the original top comment by saying things like ""their's such a big disconnect between myself and your typical redditor"" - because that's what the original top commenter is essentially doing: creating a disconnect between himself and those ""ITT who have have never hooped""  It's a caricature of *that guy who peaked in high school and always brings up that one big game to try and impress people years later*.  That's also why he said ""only to get fucked over by the refs in the 4th""...it's a reference to the 'ole ""[Man if only coach had put me in we would have won the championship](https://aleteia.org/blogs/catholic-thinking/dont-be-uncle-rico-a-moral-snatched-from-napoleon-dynamite/)"":  >I‚Äôm dead serious‚Ä¶How much you wanna make a bet I can throw a football over them mountains?‚Ä¶ Yeah‚Ä¶ If Coach woulda put me in fourth quarter, we would‚Äôve been state champions  No one is being given the nickname ""speedhawk"" lmao.  And when he says *why* his coaches called him that, it's because he had ""such a nose for basketball"", which has nothing to do with speed.    It's a satirical comment in the same vein as the ""Navy Seal 300 confirmed kills"" or ""To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand..."" copypastas.  Also it's literally just a /r/nfl [copypasta](https://old.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/e3ovc9/speedhawk/):  >Am I the only one in this sub who's actually played organized tackle football before?  >Like half of the comments I've seen on this sub are so obviously written by non-athletes that it's almost humorous.  >When I was in high school (3 year starter for our varsity football team) I would get a full-on sprint going and clock the shit outta whoever had the ball. My coaches called me ""speedhawk"" as a nickname caus I had such a nose for the football and for those three seasons I was considered the most feared safety in our conference. Senior year I led my team to the state semifinals only to get fucked over by the refs in the 4th but that's another conversation (DM me if you're interested in hearing about it)  >So, yeah. I hope yall can understand why I feel like their's such a big disconnect between myself and your typical redditor. Please tell me I'm not the only one who feels this way lol  - 4 months ago"	0

Dictatorship under Napoleon? Time to check your facts. Napoleon brought with him sweeping social reforms, introduced a civil code which to this day serves as the basis of many countries‚Äô legal system, created high schools, created the Bank of France, brought back exiled nobles, brought back freedom of religion, and undertook vast successful military conquests which consolidated his country as the premier power in Europe. And if it weren‚Äôt for him, Italy and Germany probably wouldn‚Äôt exist, as his wars led to a surge in nationalism in these areas. Sure, there was some control over the press, and he brought back slavery in the colonies, but the highs far outweigh the lows. The truth is the majority of the French people adored Napoleon.	0

People underrate how difficult it is to make a pass in the half-court in the NBA. You see players doing it with seemingly ease but they're all the best athletes in the world.  I feel like I'd get 5 rebounds over 82 games no problem. There are times the ball's just going to bounce your way. The 20 points would be difficult but possible mostly thanks to free throws and occasional wide open shots because the other team doesn't take you seriously. But the assists man. Every opposing player will smell blood in the water.	0

I'm not entirely sure why you did that racial breakdown, but okay, yep, those are accurate numbers.  The margin of error I'm referring to is about the true mean of the population, not the one individual data point in 2019. Due to the small difference in this number (4%), and the fact that the lead has shifted since as recent as 2014 and the parity at around 2016-2017, AND the fact that in a different poll I found Hispanics were actually 1% higher than whites in gay marriage acceptance (in my other comment), it's not really possible to say whether Hispanics or whites  are more accepting of gay marriage.   Your other concerns are speculation that would need to be borne out by actual evidence. Pew is a reasonably reputable source and I'm not willing to grant you this point. I can easily conceive that white people would be LESS likely to say that they were against gay marriage than Hispanic people on a poll, so the survey may actually overestimate support on whites for any variety of reasons. You have decent logic about people not willing to say they are against gay marriage, but why would Hispanic people be less willing to say that? You can come up with any reason you want but it's going to be even more speculative and untethered by evidence.  Your last problem is indicative of the problem in your modality of thinking. You've already presupposed that people of color are more homophobic, and because the evidence shows that this is not true for AAPI or Hispanics, you question the data. Would you be questioning the data if it showed like 40% numbers for Hispanics and AAPI? If you're being honest with yourself, I would guess not (but I'm not going to say for certain as that's presumptuous).	1

I bet you can bench press like 350 17 times and run a 4.3 40 huh? I bet you‚Äôre like 6‚Äô8 250 lookin like Lebron James too huh? Are you gonna tell me next that you also have a massive dick?   Also when the fuck did I ever state that I ‚Äútalk trash‚Äù you‚Äôre an assuming ass human being you know that?

EB was a tremendous basketball player - truly a GOAT member!!!!!!!

Man this is overstated. Yes it's 'rape' according to law but when you grow up in the 80s and 90s you saw college dudes banging teenagers left and right. Celebrities did this all the time. That's why it's a bigger deal now than it was 20 years ago. I am not saying Malone isn't a dick, he definitely is the way he trested his children. But it's disningenuous to view him as the kind of rapist that ignored consensual agreement. Though ironically no one brings that up qhen talking about Kobe.	0

More talented team? The Warriors had a 16 win advantage over the Cavs, the only unanimous MVP in league history, the 2nd best shooter in league history, arguably the best defensive player in the league, and a starter level top wing defender coming off the bench. All of this contributed to a top 4 offensive season for a team in league history on top of having a great defense.	1

Yep see that‚Äôs the problem with Reddit. You‚Äôre all on here pleasuring each other and looking for acceptance and illogically expect the same from everyone else; fantasizing about the world being peaceful and kind when it‚Äôs not absolute like that. I‚Äôm free to say whatever I want even if it doesn‚Äôt live up to your expectation. Redditors like you think you‚Äôve got everything and everyone figured out and that everyone lives by your soft, majority-rule, social standards. And your only defense mechanism is flipping the script and pointing out ‚Äúirony‚Äù so a bunch of faceless geeks back you up. Congratulations. But your problem is I, on the other hand, do not give a fuck about any of you or what any of you think. So I am content with coming off as douchey, immature, or whatever. It‚Äôs a risk I‚Äôll take to possibly stop seeing stupid garbage like this pussy live stream. Call it arrogance, cockiness, confidence, judgy, or whatever. If I wanna call you a pussy then I will and it doesn‚Äôt matter what age I am. You‚Äôre a pussy, and all of you people are pussies! End of story. Fuck you gonna do about it. I see no irony. But glad it‚Äôs entertaining for you and you have more content to fuel a circle jerk with everyone on here. Bc all I really see is a bunch of butthurt Redditors that didn‚Äôt get accepted by 100% of the site users and their safespace got invaded against their best wishes.

"""He boomed me"" gets used over there fairly regularly as well as ""Driving around [City] begging (thru texts)""    In r/baseball here are some good ones:    Someone asked for a story where they met a player and he was an ass to them. A commenter told a story about meeting Troy Tulowitzki that seemed... dubious, wherein Tulo allegedly told two kids to go back to their bitch parents. The top response to that comment was: ""One time I was at YYZ just minding my own business doing a Sudoku when I hear ""hey fuck face!"" I lower my book and Tulo shoots me right in the fucking throat with a nail gun."" So that gets recycled a lot kind of like the Navy SEAL copy pasta.    [The Balk Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/cpu8yc/whats_your_favorite_rbaseball_copy_pasta/ewrle9v) which are attributable to the Great u/jon_bois    Josh Beckett also makes the rounds: ""My dad briefly dated Josh Beckett's mom in high school and they ended things on good terms. They even got back in touch a few years back after he figured out social media. They send each other family photos, swap work stories (they are all retired) and occasionally even skype on holidays. Last thanksgiving, I was over at my dad's and Josh was visiting while they were skyping. His mom knows from my dad that I'm a huge baseball fan and she offered to introduce us. Well, Josh would have none of it. First he pretended to not hear her while she awkwardly made excuses for him that he was busy preparing the turkey in the kitchen (we could see him right behind her coloring with crayons or some shit), but then he rolled his eyes and said ""for fuck's sake"" loud enough for us to hear. He finally came over into full view and I shit you not, was wearing a bib and holding massive turkey legs in each of his hands. He didn't say a goddamn word. No hello or hi or even a smile. He just looked into the camera with dead eyes and just sucked the meat right off the turkey bones, one at a time, like a little kid sucking jelly off his fingers. Fucking Beckett."""	0

It is not the reserve currency for the rest of the world for no reason. For someone very learned on this topic you seem to not know much at all.   Canadian btw and while I love our healthcare system, I am not retarded enough to ignore the obvious benefits of capitalism and even aggressive capitalism.

">The end goal is a centrally planned system that allocates land for housing according to need.  So how does this work *in a practical sense?*  One obvious question is how you motivate people/companies to fund improvements to a given location. For example, I recently shelled out a decent amount of money for a number of home improvements. These ranged from ""absolutely necessary (new roof)"" to ""not necessary but contributed to the overall quality of the house (energy efficient water heater, new paint and carpet, etc).   If I don't actually own the land, then why would I ever do that? I mean, if the government can decide tomorrow to allocate my land to someone that they have ""determined"" needs it more, then why would I spend money on any of that stuff? I'd probably even put off the things like a new roof as long as I possibly could because there is nothing saying that I wouldn't get kicked out in a month and forced into another house that also needs a new roof.  I mean, do you not see that as a problem? Or do you have a realistic, practical means of still driving improvements when people don't actually own the shit that they are improving?"	0

Wade no doubt. This isn‚Äôt even a question. Whoever says KD is fucking retarded and only started watching basketball within the past few years   People forget KD was just a tall James harden before he joined a 73 win team that won a title and made 3 finals without him. His playoff efficiency ALWAYS drastically dipped compared to the regular season and he always had his worse series in the biggest games and moments   KD **WISHES** he could have have the run Dwade had in 2006   Put Dwade on those warriors teams instead of KD and they would have gone 16-0, 16-1 in both of their playoff runs  Put Trevor Ariza on those teams instead of KD and they still win at least 1 title lol that‚Äôs how stacked KDs team was   If this was asked in 2016 it would be overwhelmingly wade.

What people don't understand is your average dumb motherfucker can't tell the difference between Asian people. We're all CCP spies to these assholes.  Reddit being openly racist to Asians is nothing new. I've dealt with this shit since I was a little kid. Most of the people on Reddit will never have to experience racism firsthand and thus have no empathy. It's honestly the harsh reality of this entire situation. But hey, you guys get to post fresh maymays shitting on Asians.	0

I mean she had advocated for almost entirely the same policies as Bernie for the past ~15 years, while directly opposing many of Bidens policies so whether or not you think Bernie defines true progressivism it'd be pretty damn hard to argue she didn't go back against many of her longly held (or I guess stated is more accurate) beliefs. Policies her and Bernie both advocated for while Biden has not and will not include: legalizing weed, enacting a wealth tax, ending fracking, getting rid of superpacs/ large money donors influence in politics, getting rid of superdelegates, cover everyone on govt run health insurance and eliminate private insurance, consider a job guarantee, focus deportations only on criminals and security threats, make college free etc etc. She was loudly anti superpac but then cashed a 14.5 mil check from one silicon valley exec while claiming Bernie had superpacs (because a youth led climate action group and a nurses union chose to endorse him and gave him pennies compared to Liz's superpac, and are funded by small donations which are completely dif than being funded by a few extremely rich donors that you're then beholden too) and had been very anti super delegates going against the will of the people only until she knew she couldn't win a majority and decided she actually was okay with that if it meant her having a chance when her campaign was all but dead. And whether you think Bernie defines progressivism he was the only other progressive in the race and she willingly chose to attack him again and again, like when she all of a sudden got mad at him for something he supposedly said 8 months prior (while remaining on friendly terms with him in the interim) and loudly condemning Bernie again and again claiming he needs to be responsible for every anonymous Twitter account that says anything mean (which he did in fact denounce) while doing nothing to denounce her supporters saying heinous shit on there constantly as well. If random people tweeting snake emojis at you for you going back on things you've claimed to believe in for years is enough to not support the only candidate left in the race that had similar policiess, I think it's fair to say Warren doesn't actually give a shit about the things she's claimed to for all these years and it's pretty hard to make a case she's progessive after her actions had a huge contribution in stiffling any chance of a progessive movement making any real strides	0
It's not shocking because the country has become used to it.  American productivity since 1973 has increased by 77 percent, and if wages had kept pace with productivity, workers would be earning more than $20 an hour. Instead, over 41 million American workers ‚Äì a third of the workforce ‚Äì earn less than $12 an hour without employee-sponsored health insurance. And health costs are the number one cause of bankruptcy.    Work or be chewed apart.  You don't even deserve your health, your children don't deserve a good education, you don't deserve a safe place to live, you don't deserve equal treatment under the law... unless of course you are NOT poor. You work not because you love money but because you fear the jaws of poverty like a pack of wraiths and know your neighbors won't care to help you.	0

Yeah this is a bit too far. Houston as a city is way better than Austin. Austin is pretty overrated and now full of the west coast progressive tech yuppies that turned their cities in to an unaffordable dystopia. I suppose most of the hate austinites have towards Houston has is because it won't succumb to liberalism as soon as Austin would like it and Houston succeeds regardless in spite of it. It's kind of like you want your theory to be proven right (righties are le dumb and lefties are the best), so it colors your worldview accordingly.	0

These things are compatible   100% agreed that Asian people have faced tons of racism in the US as well. The Chinese Exclusion Act is one of the best examples, where the full weight of the government was placed behind a racist policy. Or the internment camps during world war II   Also agreed that things are more difficult to parse out between some Asian countries. Still, there are lasting scars from things like the Rape of Nanking and Japanese occupation of South Korea that give an extra heft to discrimination between those groups.    I'm not an expert and don't claim to be - still, it seems clear to me that historical injustices and current power dynamics are the key differences between discrimination and racism.	0

Neither of you all know very much I‚Äôm willing to bet and with all due respect I‚Äôve read no leagues across the globe in sports from soccer to American football to the nba speaking on no fans until a vaccine. Please stop the pessimistic views and let researchers find and develop treatments. And please before any predictions let‚Äôs see if we implement a system where we can test and monitor the virus and  hospitals can cope with the virus before they have to go into emergency crisis mode. This is much about having enough tests, tracing of COVID, research, and being able to handle patients while working on vaccines you understand.   Everyone with non factual based statements regarding sports and the coranavirus needs to stop predicting the fall and definitely 2021 while we are in the spring of 2020. The way this thing impacted society so quickly is the same way things may change for the better. Until then please chill with negative predictability shit you all have prolly done very little research on.	0

Ignore. Just ignore.      Resume the season immediately. NBA should never suspend/cancel the season. The league should never waste another year of prime LeBron.

If no team is going to wanna play, just give him MVP and just give the Lakers a title. They already beat Bucks & Clippers, so at this point NOBODY would have any doubt Lakers deserve the trophy anyways.	0

"Was careful to avoid those exact words.  I am just so fed up with this bullshit. Many of those NBA reporters probably want to stay up to date and read r/nba click a link about their work and read the worst crap, written by some embarrassing losers. It's one thing to constructively criticise lacking work or a bad take. But why does Windhorst, who does a lot of great work, get constantly shat on? For what reason in this world do people hate on Shelbourne, MacMullan and Doris Burke?  I get when people constantly hold a person with real influence or power accountable. Trump for his terrible presidency, Lebron for his Hongkong comments or Mark Cuban for the sexual harrasment scandal within the Mavs organisation. But an online crusade against a reporter who asked a disagreeable question on a shaky premise, really?  I am absolutely serious with my following assumption: ""Many of those little fuckers, had they any power in society later, would put on some black uniforms, march the streets, surpress women and straw man minorities to finally gas a few millions people."""	0

At the end of the day. This is a Chinese virus that originated in China. Calling it Covid 19 or corona virus or whatever won‚Äôt actually stop the racism against Asians. It‚Äôs a very simplistic way to look at things, almost how a child would look at it to think otherwise. We could literally call this virus ‚Äúbirthday cake‚Äù and wherever it originated from, people would be ostracized from that area. It‚Äôs not just white People doing this. It‚Äôs every culture. It‚Äôs how humanity survived thousands of years of evolution. Whenever there is a threat to the populous we always take a negative view against the threat and where it comes from.

Read on if you feel called (warning: wall of text). If not then just ignore as you might think I‚Äôm throwing propaganda around.  I don‚Äôt mean to be insensitive, I only wish to speak the hard truth. Today is a serious reminder that life comes to an end. We are immoral. We can accumulate the world and yet we still leave this earth with nothing. Even Mamba.  I just want to encourage anyone who is dumbstruck, hurt, or confused, to know that there is a God who loves you, and that life truly is fleeting. We are here (quite literally) for a blip of time. There‚Äôs way more to life than this short amount of time. Accepting Jesus into your heart changes everything. You begin to have a purpose that‚Äôs way bigger than anything here on earth; only because you can take that purpose with you beyond this life. I would love to talk more about my transformation - I‚Äôm no perfect Christian, I‚Äôm a big sinner, but life has so much more joy and meaning - even in despair like this. Please feel free to reach out if you want to talk more. Even if it‚Äôs an educated debate. I‚Äôm cool with it.	1

Those picks could easily be more valuable than the thunders picks if they tried to contend for the next few years. Nobody has any idea what Houston or the clippers will look like in 3 years it would be supremely retarded to give 4-5 of those up for a very small chance at a championship. Just because nobody looks unbeatable doesn‚Äôt mean the thunder would become anywhere near championship favorites with Beal or Holiday. Not to mention you still have to match salaries meaning they‚Äôd have to give away a huge piece of the team no matter what.	0

Here's WHO's recommendation to avoid naming it after geographic groups (among other criteria) https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2015/naming-new-diseases/en/  Honestly, I can't believe we are even having this conversation. It should really take a quantum of empathy to realize why these names should be avoided, especially considering that (a) we already have both other names that have been widely accepted, and (b) I could see Wuhan Coronavirus (though I'd avoid it), but Chinese Virus doesn't even many sense--we don't refer to Ebola by The Congo Virus.  It's quite obvious what Trump is doing. He's trying to distract from his failings by sowing resentment against China. And I'd say M.O. involves primarily sowing racial resentment. That's not surprising, given it's a trick that worked in 2016.  But I hate it. That press conference today was simply gross. Just like his commercial for Wall Street last Friday in front of the rose garden.	0

Alright boys here‚Äôs my two cents. Is calling it the ‚ÄúChinese Virus‚Äù racist? No. Will calling it the ‚ÄúChinese Virus‚Äù cause some morons I‚Äôm on country to lash out at Asian-Americans? More than likely, yes.  I agree with China getting shit for this. They had SARS, then Bird a Flu, and now Corona Virus. It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous that they practically churn out a new epidemic each decade. Even worse, at least from my understanding, the origins are all similar. It always starts inside some unregulated wet or live market.  However, calling it the China Virus will do more harm than good. Unfortunately, some idiot out there will hear ‚ÄúChina Virus‚Äù and likely take it out on innocent Asian-Americans. People are dumb and hateful, and will use any reason they can to get riled up.   I just think looking at it from everyone‚Äôs perspective, the best thing to do would be to call it the coronavirus or whatever. We can still give China shit and keep the virus name neutral.	1

"Names themselves are never racist, sexist, etc. in isolation. The word ""faggot"" itself is not homophobic, and ""bitch"" is not misogynistic. It's how those words have transformed over time to demonize specific groups of people that make them bad. In other words, context matters.  The context here is that people are being attacked because people inexplicably falsely equivocate ""Chinese Virus"" to mean people of Chinese descent have it and carry into their neighborhoods.   I guarantee you if MERS were ravaging America right now we would also see a movement to refer to it by its scientific name EMC-2012 as well and instead of Asians, it would be Middle Easterns being vilified (again, or still). And I would be all for it instead of defending xenophobic rhetoric on reddit because it literally wouldn't hurt me to do so and maybe save a life or two in the process.  You have actual redditors in this very thread talking about how their lives are being affected by this type of rhetoric that emboldens racists. Posts like yours that deflect and miss the forest for the trees doesn't make things any better.  > not a reason to call somebody a racist  The past 3.5 years aside, the POTUS speaks on behalf of all Americans, does he not? If there is rhetoric that instigates violence against Americans, should he use it? Just because the word itself is just a synonym doesn't make it okay."	0

The minimum salary is $582,000. That‚Äôs $7097 per game before taxes (say $8000 because it‚Äôs easier math)  $8000 * 65 games is $520,000 before taxes earned to date (most teams have played around 65 games)  That‚Äôs around $300,000 after taxes.   If you‚Äôre broke after making that much since October and are living paycheck to paycheck then you‚Äôre absolutely retarded  The minimum salary is $893,310 not $582,000 so my math is wrong.

I would like to see Duncan carry that horrible Minnesota team for 12 years. Garnett was the reason why fans were coming to T-Wolves' games. He meant a lot to city of Minnesota and he knew that, thats why he didnt leave them for all those years. Never forget that legendary MVP season in 2004. where Garnett carried T-Wolves to the Conference Finals. Bill Russell said that if Garnett doesn't win a ring, he will give him one of his. Luckily Garnett got his well deserved ring in 2008. He even came back to play his last season in Minnesota. We will never see another player like Garnett. The Greatest PF in NBA history. A role model for millions NBA fans. Thank you Kevin for everything, and congratulations on becoming a HOFer.	0

If you read enough history you see this pattern over and over and over again. Concentrated wealth leads to revolution or collapse if it's not met with regulation first. Wealth distribution in the US today resembles that of historical societies on the brink and it's only been accelerating in that direction. With some luck it will only be a wave of political revolution and not violence, but that depends on the ultra wealthy being accountable to law.	0

China certainly has their issues but they're not the reason the US has the highest death toll from COVID-19 in the world right now.  I agree with Lin, we should stop with the finger pointing. We need to take action and demand that those in office take action. We need to be proactive because simply looking for someone to blame is just a distraction, and let's be honest, a lot of it is rooted in racism.

Michael Jordan did it 4 times, arguably should have been 5 x in 1997 (when he had superior stats to Malone and much better record).  Each time also leading the league in scoring and winning the Ring 3 out of the 4 (should have been 4 out of 5).    That's the 'Original' Mamba mentality.

"It's not devaluing if you value different things. It's why everyone has a different person for the GOAT Convo.  If I was able to change history, I'd say James Harden didn't deserve his and Giannis's MVP coming up would also go to LeBron.  Others disagree because it's TRUE, Harden had 15 more wins, but his stats were worse and he clearly had better help, along with a very strong narrative of being ""ROBBED"" twice. Everyone was on his dick in 2018.  And Giannis ALSO deserves MVP, his season is comparable to 2013 LeBron and 2016 Curry, but I'd still choose LeBron because I feel like he's still better and has a bigger impact.  My opinions are just that, opinions. Learn to make your own judgements."	0

I disagree, it is not a transphobic point to question or wonder otherwise. Where are you getting that 1%? How many people regret without going through the pain of transitioning back? More details can be found here: https://quillette.com/2020/01/02/the-ranks-of-gender-detransitioners-are-growing-we-need-to-understand-why/  I get that a lot of people in the world are trying to discredit homosexuality and trans rights, but if we are going to label anything contrary to unwavering support as transphobic then I feel we are doing a disservice to the trans community. To people like that person in the video and others. Also I feel my point about Kim Petras shows that I don't believe the feeling of being born in the wrong sex is some delusion.	1

">You have not debunked a single thing in that video. The only thing you proved is that the word soon is technically true if you want to be generous and include that we will have it by next flu season.   I'll keep copying and pasting until you address it.   LMAO okay man. The video is nothing but bullshit. The virus wasn't a big deal in America mid January at that point. No need for revisionist history. Saying that most people will get better is TRUE. Saying that it will likely be over soon is TRUE. Saying there are treatments and vaccines coming soon is TRUE. Like the majority of what he said in there is factually correct. Why can't you understand that? He has taken the measures necessary to get this under control. It's also his job to not fucking spread panic and throw us into anarchy.  Literally a week before Trump said he didn't think it was a pandemic in January the WHO was saying that human to human transmission of the disease was not happening. The entire fucking world wasn't taking it seriously at that point.  >Comparing to regular drugs development is a strawman. His intent was not ""dont worry we will have a vaccine within 12 years""  His intent is that we will have something to fight the virus in the near future. Having a vaccine ready by next flu season is fucking soon man i dont give a fuck what you say. Keep ignoring the fact that therapeutic treatments are available already. Doesn't fit your retarded narrative.  >That was a total of what 5-7 seconds of the video. How about the other 2:05? The video is date stamped, it is not trying to skew what he said, even said there are only 8 cases in America at the time. That does not dismiss the criticism of him saying ""we have shut it down"" while cases were on the rise in January, not does it address the other 95% of the video.  I addressed most of it in my previous comments. Please read slower.  >Your link about test kits having the hiccup (which I cant even read because you linked a website that forces you to create an account) does not dismiss the criticism of him saying ""as of yesterday and today anyone can get a test"" These test production errors occurred in February, it was known at the time we did not have enough tests and he lied about it.  How does it fucking not? Companies preparing and shipping tests tell trump they are ready and how many will be available now and in the future. Trump then says they're available. Then you have the issues come up. Is it that hard to follow dude?  >Now we are on to whataboutisms. I am not a fan of any of the people you have named. I have never voted democrat in my life and am just as critical to them as I am Trump. Wish you were too, but your likely part of the Trump cult who are political hacks who consistently trash the media for being fake news but never Trump who is one of the largest providers of it.  DGAF who you voted for. You would be surprised who I voted for in the past but that's completely irrelevant. Doesn't make your retarded logic any better. It's not whataboutism, it's admitting that the dude isn't perfect but that video is bullshit and is overplaying any apparent mishandling of the virus.   >Please show me where you debunked that Trump did not say cases are going to go down in late February when there were 80K+ cases in the world?  Talking about the vaccines. What he said there was flat out wrong and I already said as such.  >If you reread what I wrote, I specifically said Trump did not say this just that he consistently endorses the people who made those dangerous claims. I said people at Fox went even further than Trump did. I did not say Trump said it was a hoax nor that he praised their specific response to the hoax. The favorite network of the guy who consistently says ""fake news"" were endangering people with their careless reporting on the virus.  Such an absurd way to attempt to attach something to Trump it's not worthy of a response."	0

I didn't play, but I'm from southern Indiana and my local high school played Washington in sectionals one year, which is the school all of the Zeller brothers came through. Cody was there at this point, and he had a really quiet first half, just grabbed a bunch of boards and had maybe 10 points. We were up going into halftime, not by much, but we were up. I think Cody had like 25 points in the second half, nobody could do anything to stop him, grabbed every rebound, pretty much everything he put up dropped. Tom Crean was there scouting and everyone knew it was for Cody, I'm pretty sure it was his senior year	0

If Cavs never double teamed curry, he would average like 35ppg and iggy won't average more than 10ppg.

">all people making these comments about a players likeness are gay  No but I don't care either way. You can be straight and admire handsome men  >2) all these comments are humorous and not somewhat irritating and potentially hurtful  Can you explain how they're hurtful? I never got that impression.  (Except the dwight stuff).  Sure it's not always funny. I've rarely if ever been offended or hurt. Again, can only speak for me.  >3) no ""gay people"" are offended by constantly mocking their sexuality  There's a fine line. The Dwight stuff reaaaaally crossed it for me but I'm a hypocrite and cracked a joke or two. I felt bad reading through that thread though. Dwight didn't deserve that and that's really the only time here I felt like gayness was callously the butt of the joke.  >4) my comment is aimed at you if you aren't even trying to mock/make fun of/dehumanize these athletes, their sexual preferences and their look   You mean isn't?"	1

I wouldn't say that. Auto-rotation in essence is just using airflow through the blades to give them energy, since the blades are being given energy it also means the fall is retarded. On approach to the ground the pilot changes the angle of the blades to generate lift and this quickly depletes the inertial energy built up. Too soon and you run out of energy and begin falling, and land with excessive speed (crash). Too late and you don't retard your fall enough and crash. There are also a lot more conditions and failures that can prevent a successful auto-rotation.	1

But Wade never said anything about her transitioning, at least not completely, to my knowledge. Only that the name and pronouns used would be changed.  People conveniently ignored that in the thread on hereand started ranting about how wrong it was for a 12 year old to be put on horamone blockers or go through surgery when Wade never mentioned that.  He simply said they would respect her wishes and refer to her as she/her and by a female name. He also mentioned they would be talking to professionals about this and educating themselves.	1
She started re-tweeting screenshots of the angry emails she was getting from fans without redacting the email addresses.   That is the policy the Post suspended her for.  She needs some time to chill out, she was basically gloating that she had made people so angry.   IMO, major news media organizations need to just ban their reporters from Twitter. It's shocking how childish and unprofessional some journalists behave on there.	1

I cannot think or comprehend of anything more cucked than having a daughter. Honestly, think about it rationally. You are feeding, clothing, raising and rearing a girl for at least 18 years solely so she can go and get ravaged by another man. All the hard work you put into your beautiful little girl - reading her stories at bedtime, making her go to sports practice, making sure she had a healthy diet, educating her, playing with her. All of it has one simple result: her body is more enjoyable for other men. Raised the perfect girl? Great. Who benefits? If you're lucky, a random man who had nothing to do with the way she grew up, who marries her. He gets to ravage her every night. He gets the benefits of her kind and sweet personality that came from the way you raised her. As a man who has a daughter, you are LITERALLY dedicating at least 20 years of your life simply to raise a girl for another man to enjoy. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck. Think about it logically.	0

Unfortunately, no matter how hard a person might *consciously* try to treat every person the same way and avoid prejudice based on appearance, it's impossible to avoid feeling what's been embedded into one's subconscious mind. News, advertisements, films, tv, etc all have a hand in scultping the way we frame the world, and it's difficult to undo all that, all the time. Acknowledging the existence of these *implicit biases* is a great first  step towards undoing them.	1

"okay, so not really any love for brokers from me . . .  . . . but y'all are morons if you think ticketmaster, promoters and  artists ""hate"" scalpers.  They literally create them.  Intentionally.  Because it means they can set simple price points and sell out stadiums AND make more money.  The alternative is much riskier.  Put another way: you COULD (if you do it JUST RIGHT) make just as much  money on ticket sales with a 1/2 full arena and a ""properly"" priced  market.  But then they would all die on merch and concessions, AND have a  pissed off artist and promoter who looks like they can't draw the  venues they book.  But instead, until 2018 ticketmaster OWNED ITS OWN RESELLER MARKETPLACES.  GET IT?  The reseller market is a DEMAND CUSHION created BY AND FOR the ticketing agencies and the promoters and venues they work for.  If they wanted it to go away, they would price differently.  Instead, they  throw that entire margin to the brokers because its not worth the risk  of not selling as many $15 Bud Lights.  These people aren't stupid.  Ticket scalpers are not that far from independent, un-contracted employees.  They perform a service for the ticketing  agencies/teams/venues/artists/promoters.  I'm sorry to be the one  informing you of this.  It's the  billionaire-who's-sports-team-you-worship's fault.  Fucking duh.  tldr: blame ticketmaster you hapless fuckwits.  It's their fault we live these lies.  In fact, I'm pretty sure even Ticketmaster is more of a PR fall-guy than some kind of mastermind.  They literally exist for you to blame."	0

You shouldn't get multiple free timeouts (that last forever) in the fourth quarter of a game.  The NBA should take notice and fix that shit, instead of trying to pretend like it isn't happening.  like real shit, 99.9% the time we see the replay on the broadcast and we can make the call almost immediately.

I have a funny story about Boston: little over a decade ago I moved to NYC and had a friend living in South Boston. I was waiting on a job so I went up there to stay for a bit. We were getting around on bikes and I was riding my friends girlfriends bike as I didn‚Äôt have one. It was this pink mountain bike looking thing. Well as we‚Äôre riding down the street I hear a loud noise hit my spokes, a decent size stick. I turn around shocked to see a what looked like a 12 year old? Say ‚Äúnice Bike Fag*ot‚Äù. I start laughing because it was a pretty wild scene. He follows it up with a ‚Äúwetback‚Äù.   Im not implying anything about Boston fans. In fact I have a gay cousin raising adopted kids with his partner there too who are big fans. Will just never forget that story.	1

"You saying it's racist doesn't make it racist. It's not racist. Under your premise, any joke or accurate assessment of a geographical configuration is racist. You're a gaslighting typical keyboard warrior. You aren't calling out anything, you devalue actual racism because you call everything racist. These are facts. It's like Bill Maher says ""You lose any credibility when you start calling everything under the sun racist.""  And you cut off the definition on purpose ""prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior."" Because you can't handle the fact you can criticise entire groups of people with valid assessments. It's a unsound premise you hold and it's why people tune you people out. You're laughed at. An embarrassment."	0

I don‚Äôt know if finding blogs about preseason/playoff predictions really tells us the 2010 Celtics and 2009 Magic were better than the 92 Blazers, 93 Suns, 96 Sonics, 97-98 Jazz. Especially when bloggers weren‚Äôt really around during the 90s.   I only know how great those teams were because broadcasters talked about them during the 96-98 Jordan run, my time on basketball forums on insidehoos, realgm, etc (2009-2013).   Anyway, here are some ‚Äúblogs‚Äù about teams that never won a championship. The Dwight Magic aren‚Äôt on any of the lists, neither were the 2010 Celtics. Though the C‚Äôs won in 08, one of the articles won‚Äôt list them as it was more about multi-year squads.   https://www.sportscasting.com/great-nba-teams-didnt-win-championship/  https://www.chatsports.com/nba/a/Throwback-Thursday-The-10-Best-NBA-Teams-Never-to-Win-a-Championship-17635#/  https://www.realclearhistory.com/articles/2018/05/31/10_best_nba_teams_that_didnt_win_a_title_317.html  https://www.basketballnetwork.net/the-6-best-nba-teams-that-didnt-win-a-championship/  https://www.complex.com/sports/2013/06/the-best-nba-teams-to-never-win-an-nba-title/	0

He did, and he did so more than Pippen.  Contrary to popular opinion, Michael Jordan ‚Äì not Scottie Pippen ‚Äì   most often drew the opposition‚Äôs toughest perimeter assignment. However,  it was close: Jordan did so 8 times, while Scottie Pippen assumed this  responsibility 7 times.     ***After reviewing the game film from the  1991 NBA Finals, it turns out the Jordan ‚Äì not Pippen ‚Äì guarded Magic  Johnson for nearly 85-90% of that series. The exception was the first  half of Game 2 and the 2H of Game 3.***     **Out of 24 playoff  series, Michael Jordan ‚Äì not Scottie Pippen -guarded the better   perimeter player more often. Specifically,Jordan guarded the better  perimeter player during 13 playoff series, while Pippen guarded the  better perimeter player 11 times.**     So Pippen only guarded  Magic for 2 halves....and yet most people think he guarded him most of  the series. Its amazing what some highlights, reputation, and word of  mouth can do.     I would say 1998 is a tie tho, I know Reggie was the Pacers best player but Pippen guarded Mark Jackson which was crucial....     But still it is a HUGE myth that Pippen mostly guarded the other teams best player.	0

He was known for getting to work early and putting in extra data entry before his day even started, so I decided I'd show up at 5am and impress him. I figured I'd easily be there first.  So I manage to roll in at 5am, and when I got there I see one desk lamp on. I walked over and saw him just entering crosstab after crosstab. I couldn't believe it. He was drenched in sweat and didn't even acknowledge my presence. The cleaning crew was there, and when I asked them, they said he'd been there since 3am just crunching numbers. What a legend. He truly Excelled in anything he put his mind to.	1

Just because you can have an opinion, doesn't mean it's a good one. Or one that should be respected or validated. Literally based off everything we've seen Trump do, if you still support him you're a POS.	0
A.) The 'average voter' doesn't understand things like federal monetary policy either, does that somehow mean it isn't fucking important?      B.) China and CCP are different things. I'm not sure you actually understand that the CCP is the political party that rules one of the two countries called 'China'.      C.) Even if you are aware of B, separation must always be drawn between a people and their government. Idk which side of the political spectrum you're on (assuming you're from the USA), but do you want to be closely identified with whatever stupid decisions Obama / Trump have made? Was it your decision to go to war in Afghanistan & Iraq? Were you responsible for the lax policy that lead to the current rapid spread of Covid 19 in the US?  No, it was your government.	0

As an unbiased observer what the fuck are the refs looking at in this game	1
"It's all the same thing. What he said isn't even the PC version. In black culture a man being ""feminine,"" ""a bitch,"" ""having female tendencies,"" or just outright being called gay are all the same. The thought is that a man is supposed to be strong or whatever and the woman weak and submissive  Many black people do not differentiate between femininity and homosexuality for a guy. I've had many conversations like that. When I told my fam that they are men that go through the process of being defined as a woman that still date women they just couldn't compute. Like if you told a robot a paradox.  Quotes like the one from Morris exemplifies this. He knew what he was saying and what he was saying is all the same."	1

I am saying of the **top rebounders in the NBA** and you're comparing Giannis' rebounding statistics to Lebron, Harden, and Westbrook?  &#x200B;  Top 5 Rebounders:  &#x200B;  Drummond @ 15. 8 REB  Gobert @ 14.6 REB  Whiteside @ 14 REB  Capela @ 13.8 REB  Giannis @ 13.4 REB  [https://stats.nba.com/players/rebounding/?sort=REB&dir=1](https://stats.nba.com/players/rebounding/?sort=REB&dir=1)  &#x200B;  Top 5 Contested Rebounders:  &#x200B;  Drummond @ 7.3 C.

Culturally, 2007 was a long time ago. And even young adults (18-27 or so) can hold some pretty immature, dumb thoughts that get straightened out by life experience.   In the 1990s, when LeBron grew up, homophobia was part of the built in culture. Go back and lock at the gay jokes in Friends and Seinfeld and other movies and sitcoms.   None of those jokes would fly now. In Frienda, Ross‚Äôs wimpiness is built on the fact that he wasn‚Äôt man enough to prevent his wife from turning lesbian.	0

AI averaged 36 PPG in the finals against a Lakers team that swept everyone in the West. Iverson was supposed to get swept too but he made a statement in game 1 by carrying the 76ers top a win with 50 points. Curry only averaged 30 PPG last finals because pf his 47 point outlier, and he only got 47 points because Raptors were up 20 points the whole game so the defense was more relaxed. Every other finals he averaged 21-26 PPG on like 40% FG, there's a reason why he never won Finals MVP. Curry never scored when it mattered, he basically got trash points. Even the last finals when he averaged 30 PPG, Klay was the MVP as he was scoring with efficiency and scored to keep the game close. Curry was shooting them out of the games and then scored when GS was already up, thanks to Klay. Curry had that great 47 point game, but like I said, as great as that performance was, they were never a threat to get the game close so they were basically empty stats. Curry also has other players to take the pressure off of scoring from him and he still is inefficient and can't score when he's called to do it. You're trying to say Iverson never played the level of performance that Steph did in the finals? You're correct, because he was at a different level than Steph. Iverson was the only option and still scored on the Lakers, and that's with Shaq protecting the paint. You're so retarded it's hilarious. Bullshit nostalgia? Nah use your eyes and watch the game. Call a spade a spade when you see it, and the spade is that Curry can't score at will, Iverson can. That's why AI averaged 36 PPG in the finals, more than what Curry has averaged in FIVE finals appearances. That's why AI averaged 28-34 PPG in the regular season even though he was the only option to score and make plays during his prime. In terms of scoring, AI is better than Curry.	0

Based on what. In the first month of the season KD is averaging 27ppg on 68.1 TS% and Curry 26ppg on 65.7 TS%. Curry has a greater playmaking load than Durant and was still the centerpiece of their offball actions that the foundation of their offense is built upon.  It was very much so a 1A, 1B partnership. Lots of debates of who was the best player on the team with no decisive answer.	0
Exactly. He had blinders on as a competitor and that can result in being an asshole to even teammates. Then after the rape trial when his whole image was at his lowest, he leaned into it and the mamba was born.   Whoever was his marketing team, and obviously Kobe himself really did an amazing job marketing wise.   Off the court, everything points to him being pretty different.	0

Dirks one championship has more weight and meaning for his legacy that it catapults him into the same status as kobe or Lebron (also he‚Äôs pretty high on all time scorers list). He had been with the same team his whole career and just as he was reaching his twilight he upset the greatest team ever assembled (up to that point). I think Dirk will also be remembered for revolutionizing his position and the NBA as a whole. He was the first legit all star 3 point shooting 7 footer	0

> He grew up playing soccer and ice hockey but lived in poverty in the Saint-Michel neighborhood. He dropped out of high school at age 16 and worked as a cook and dishwasher in a St-Hubert restaurant.[3] In 2012, he was offered a spot on a tournament basketball team, and scored 44 points in the tournament final.  It seems that like Giannis, he is a soccer reject who started to play Basketball late in life because he realised that being tall is the most important thing in Basketball and he is very tall.  In 2012 he was 19 years old... He played his first Basketball game at the age of 19.   So yes, he is in the NBA just because he is very tall.  What a dumb sport.  Then you wonder why Gobert did what he did.... he is an entitled prick who is getting paid millions just for being very tall, like this Boucher dude.	0

Honestly I think it would be fairly easy, as long as your above 6ft. The reality is the assists would come pretty quick as I think I'm a pretty good passer with decent handles(I obvi would get killed by an nba or even college defender, but think I could at least get 10 assists over 82 games in a half court setting)  and 5 rebounds across the season would come just based on lucky bounces. 20 points would be difficult depending on playing time, however most nba players would probably just give you tons of space and guard the actual other NBA players on the court lol.	0

The record and the championships don't say much. UCLA had won two consecutive championships before Kareem and then went on to win four straight the second he left. They were a ridiculously dominant team regardless of him and won multiple championships and rarely lost games without him.  Kareem is in the conversation, but to act like he is undeniably the GOAT is plain absurd... Go look at what Bird did in his three years at Indiana fucking State and you will understand why. Bill Walton also has a legitimate claim as the college basketball GOAT and so has Oscar Robertson.  So yeah, saying that calling anyone besides Kareem the GOAT is ridiculous actually is absolutely retarded.	0

You‚Äôre telling me all of these players are lying, and you‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs telling the truth?Come on now.  > Why do you refuse to acknowledge that Brown and Tatum took a step forward this year because Kyrie is gone? It's fairly clear that you refuse to acknowledge any narrative that involves Kyrie taking any blame for the Celtics last season.  That isn‚Äôt ‚Äúclear‚Äù whatsoever.  Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are 3rd overall picks in their 3rd and 4th seasons respectively. This is exactly when they‚Äôre *supposed* to be taking a leap into star players. Their play this season is literally a natural, year to year progression that elite young prospects are supposed to go through. It isn‚Äôt anywhere near as simple as ‚ÄúKyrie‚Äôs gone so they‚Äôre better‚Äù. Their play this season is the result of several seasons work in the league and the game finally slowing down for them.  > Me calling you an idiot is not ""taking this personally"" the same way I can call flat earthers idiots casually and not be emotionally invested.  Throwing personal insults because somebody disagrees with you about a basketball player is absolutely taking it personally. Especially when that person comes with facts. You‚Äôre just upset you lost an argument.  > You are the one who seems personally invested in this Kyrie adoration, not me  In what way? I have no reason to adore Kyrie. I‚Äôm just not small minded enough to let r/nba narratives affect my opinion of a player.  Let me put it simply. There isn‚Äôt a single front office in the league that would trade Kyrie for DLo should they have the chance. Not a single one. If you believe any of them would then your player evaluation skills are severely lacking."	0

> You're dense lol. He literally lost cartilage and developed arthritis. Arthritis directly leads to loss of athleticism. It's 'minor' in the sense that the injury itself has a fast recovery time but it also causes permanent damage as he's had hip issues his entire career. He went through arthroscopic surgery. The very fact that you're arguing this is fucking stupid. Just watch him play. All his speed is gone. Before the surgery, his entire gait was fucked up when walking. When running he was limping around like a clumsy 7 footer, he couldn't cut, and he couldn't jump.  Holy shit, Basketball players are soft as fuck if that's a tough injury, it doesn't get more minor than that minor injury.  > He literally did run out of luck because it was a degenerative hip issue that was affecting him for his entire career until a freak injury finally took him out. You think scoring 53 points in the playoffs is luck? You think dropping 29 a game is luck?   Yes, it is when 1 year later you become 100% garbage for no reason, I'd understand if he broke his leg in half, but he didn't get any major injury or problem.  Guy ran out of luck.  > You're the only one that actually thinks it's a minor injury lmfao.  Because it is a minor injury.   > Why do you continue to pretend that you know shit about basketball? He's the third best point guard in history. was all-NBA 7 times, and was a perennial top 7 player in his prime. You probably don't think Charles Barkley is good either, because you're not a basketball fan.  Are you fucking serious? Those are two bums who never won shit. How can you set the bar so low for your athletes? What the fuck dude...  > He was a critical role player for the championship Mavericks, and continues to be a decent contributor.  What the fuck? Quick search.  18 minutes per game in the 2011 playoffs, he was a bench player, 9 points and 4 assists per game and no defense, he got most of those points and assists in garbage time. And you want to tell me that he was good?  Get the fuck out of here you delusional manlet. Haha.  The Mavericks would have still won the championship without him... As simple as that.	1

Democratic socialism ‚â† socialism, he literally isn't a true socialist basing your argument around 'well if he was a true socialist' is just really dumb to begin with, like your whole argument is that him being wealthy at 78 discounts all the good he's done for humanity is just batshit. The average net worth of Americans aged 70-79 is 1.1 million he's got 2 million, really not living like some king and it's not mental gymnastics to explain to you how he inherited a home and has a one bedroom apartment to go along with his modest house.   If he wasn't a senator and house representative making the salary that he makes he wouldn't have been able to enact any change at all, and he wrote a book people decided to buy that's about him fighting for political change, doesn't go against anything he believes in, he's fine with people making money he literally just wants rich people to pay more taxes... Like I said he's advocating for extremely wealthy people to pay taxes, for the massively rich to pay their workers a fair and livable wage not 1/40,000 of what they make, for a healthcare system that will be cheaper than our current system costing the average American less while guaranteeing comprehensive coverage for every American while our current system leaves ~80mil Americans underinsured or completely uninsured and has completely reshaped the political discourse of one of two political parties in the us. Look at exit polling in literally every primary so far that shows widespread support for m4a and tell me he hasn't done anything, when soon it will become political necessity for Dems to back a policy that would keep 60k people a year from needlessly dying from lack of healthcare/ unafforable coverage. He's been the leading voice on raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and has succeeded in doing that in a number of states. He's gotten major funding for local community health centers that help the underserved with vital services. He's defended poc lgbtq and women's rights since long before it was a politically viable strategy to do so. He's pushed to stop cuts to social security and succeeded in doing so multiple times, he's fought for funding for the VA so veterans aren't abandoned by the govt they served. All this success in helping people but it's all just self serving and inexcusable for him to work in one of the few jobs that he can push for meaningful reform in bc he's given a good salary to do so??? Democratic socialism isn't about making sure no one is wealthy, it's about making sure those that aren't have sufficient safety nets to keep them from needlessly dying from lack of health coverage, lack of a living wage etc. He's argued against having massive donors backing political campaigns that lead to the wealthy having an undue say on policy, and shown that a grassroots, small donor campaign is viable. He's passed so many amendments that have helped working class people throughout the last 30 years man.  Saying he's contributed basically nothing to society is blatantly false, he might not have succeeded in every one of his efforts, but he's completely changed the political landscape of our country and the fact that he's getting 80+ % support of people 30 and under suggest that his ideas will have a very lasting impact on this country and the world	0

Obama and Trump have not caused the deaths of anywhere near as many people as Bush did. Libya, the drone program, and the typical coups that Obama backed were all awful and Trump is loose cannon, who seems ready at any minute to start a genocide of brown people. However, from a foreign policy stand point alone Bush and his entire administration deserve to be hanged at the Hague. The comparison isn't even close. He started a war that killed nearly a million people that he justified with evidence he knew was fraudulent explicitly to gain access to Iraq's oil reserves. Reserves that he wound up handing over to the Chinese when it was all said and done. Every person to die as result of warfare in Iraq since 2003 has died because Bush was willing to lie to Congress, the UN, the courts, and America at large to get his rich buddies even richer.  Trump is pure evil, I'd say one of the most despicable men to ever hold the office. But his incredible capacity for evil lacks the resume that Bush's did. Bush is by far the most destructive and morally bankrupt man to hold the presidency in my lifetime, and probably yours too.	1

Reposting from another thread to spread awareness:  Damn.  Not to take away from Jaemal‚Äôs embarrassment because I know firsthand how it feels but this really throws back to the time my fucking sister posted our video on her finsta.  I didn‚Äôt even wanna go to school the next day cuz everyone already knew (we were 2 grades apart, she was a junior and i was a freshmen)  Prayers go out to Jaemal for this. Shit is embarrassing af and it‚Äôs honestly the worst feeling. I‚Äôm probably gonna reach out to him to let him know he‚Äôs not alone  All in all, let‚Äôs respect this man‚Äôs mistake and move on from this. It‚Äôs extremely embarrassing for your videos to go on public by accident and I really wouldn‚Äôt wish it on anyone‚Äî celebrity or not and hung or not.

Go look at Kawhis 4th quarter stats from each of the games in the 2019 finals.  Game 1 - 1 for 2 FGs  Game 2 - 1 for 6 FGs  Game 3 - 3 for 4 FGs  Game 4 - 1 for 2 FGs  Game 5 - 5 for 12 FGs   Game 6 (Closeout Game) - 0 for 4 FGs - 0 rebounds - 0 assists - 0 blocks - 0 steals.  Kawhi was pretty non existent in a lot of these 4th quarters. The closeout game he was pretty atrocious. We just don‚Äôt remember or care because his name isn‚Äôt Lebron. Can you imagine if Lebron had that stat line to close out a finals and his team won anyways? People still give Lebron shit over the Kyrie shot, even tho Lebron outscored him 11 to 5 and shot a better % in that quarter. VanVleet has 12, Siakem had 5 points, as many as Kyrie had.. and yet not a single person ever mentions it.   I‚Äôm not saying he can‚Äôt close, but he‚Äôs not this god level closer people pretend he is.	1

Like, you are afraid it will destroy society, or that gay people existing will make your kids gay, or, most commonly, that men make you feel a certain way and the idea of gay people makes you afraid that you are gay yourself. I think it is a perfect word. Never met anyone that hated gay people that I would describe as anything other than afraid of the gay community.	1

So the spurs outnumbered the Heat in 2014?  Really?  I mean, I guess 15>3.    And, yes, we agree that Lebron choked.  But with your username you should realize that the scheme that the Mavs employed on Lebron in that series had him choking.  Any time he was able to get around his man on the perimeter he was met in the lane by the Mavs zone.  The Mavs have publicly said that they wanted to just make him a passer and that's exactly what happened.  So give some credit to the Mavs braintrust while acknowledging the choke job.  (Oh, and I just watched a bunch of that finals.  Kidd did a masterful job of bodying Lebron.)	0

Yea, beside that one year averaging 20, his previous 2 years he was averaging 19. And he's doing this with literally the slowest paced team in the entire team for all 3 of those years. He also led that Jazz team to 51 teams in a harder west beating a CP led team (granted, Blake only played 3 games but availability is the best ability and its not like a fluke thing either since Blake is notoriously injury prone)	1
Remember when they paid him like 180 million dollars.  And like 8 million dollars the year after he retired.  He can feel how he wants to feel, but (in the real world) imagine calling someone a snake who pays you 8 million dollars to sit at home for a year	0

John Wall WILL be fine and WILL still be an all-star caliber player when he returns especially with all the medical advances today. A lot of people seem to forget that these are ELITE ATHLETES/ ALPHA MALES physically. They are not your normal human beings. The achilles he tore was on was not on the leg he jumps from plus looking at his workouts he still looks pretty damn fast.   John Wall himself says that this is the most healthiest that he's been since his rookie year or something like that. Which is reasonably because he's been carrying the team for a long time but now that Beal is a top SG in the nba he doesn't have to carry a lot.  If this was the 90s or 2000s when the league was at it's most physical, then yea I would be a little concerned but in TODAY'S nba where teams allow dudes to walk in the lane and defense is sooooo weak, I'm not worried about Wall one bit. I predict that he'll average around 18 pts, 10 asts, 6 rebs, 1.5 stls, 0.9 blks next season.  To your Derrick Rose point. Rose has said himself that he holds back and doesn't play as hard as he used to due to his prior injuries because he is thinking about life after basketball and being able to do things with his son etc. The man still has hops.	0

"Tf you mean ""Lmao did you really just ask that?"" You implied that Jordan leaving the Bulls equated to them going from 57 wins to 55 the year without him. It's flat out wrong. Critical thinking my fucking ass.   > transparently chasing rings  Are you just dense then? If you want to talk so much about Jordan's team changing after him leaving (which isn't what you fucking meant at all you fucking mong), let's look at the differences between Miami the year before that ""gOt BoUNceD oUt oF ThE FiRSt rOuNd"". Added: Mike Bibby, **CHRIS FUCKING BOSH**, Eddie House, Ilgauskas, and Mike Miller. The idea that Miami wasn't a stacked deck unlike joining the Celtics or Spurs is such horseshit.  > And when he left Miami, he chose the cavs  Jeez, I wonder if it had anything to do with the immense amount of draft capital they had and immediately turned into Kevin Love? I seem to remember in his Letter to Cleveland or whatever there was no mention of either Anthony Bennett or Andrew Wiggins and I wonder why? Maybe because they were getting shipped out on the next flight leaving Cleveland Hopkins airport.  >And then the same thing when he joined the lakers  And there was a huge amount of fanfare for him saying ""they were going to be patient, this was a learning process, they won't be instant contenders"", just for him to be passive-aggressive in the media and for Anthony Davis to sewer another franchise to try and force his way to LA. **And still** within 365 days of him being in LA, him and Klutch strong-armed a franchise into getting him a unanimous top 10 player/probable top 5 player in the league.  Cite David Griffin all you want, he holds no water for me. For all the talk about what a great GM he is, he hasn't drafted shit in New Orleans besides Zion (a gimme), and had his job saved by LeBron after he was at the helm when they drafted Anthony Bennett and Andrew Wiggins. For every story from David Griffin about LeBron not meddling, there's one from Pat motherfucking Riley about how **a month into his first season with the Heat** he asked Riley if he would fire Spoelstra and take over the team.  Who do you think has more cachet in the NBA? A GM who has done nothing noteworthy in his career besides cater to LeBron for the 3 years they were together, or **PAT. FUCKING. RILEY**?"	1
If we're just blindly inserting prime 1st peat MJ into the equation statistically, he wins any close series LeBron ever had:   LeBron choked in 2007, 2011, 2013, 2015. His average finals were 2012 and 2016, while best by far was 2014.   MJ loses 2017-2018. If we just insert MJ's stats for LeBron's he easily wins 2016 finals against an injured Warriors team. He might even win 2015 finals as well when you look at LeBron's inefficiency (47% TS) compared to 60%+ that MJ always had. The 2014 is a tossup. We all know 2013 was completely luck based and LeBron didn't play well at all until game 7 and average in game 4/6, so MJ gets this as well. 2012 MJ gets it. 2011 I would probably say yes. 2007 was a horrible finals by LeBron - 22  pts 42% TS - and they had 2 close games. So at the very least MJ takes that series to 6.   Again, all dumb hypothetical since MJ's stats would look quite different with the rules changing.	0

Whenever Hakeem defended Shaq he was basically rendered useless, and Hakeem stopped him so many times. Shaq said himself that the way he played against opposing big men was to get in their heads; Hakeem had none of that. Shaw admitted himself Hakeem got in HIS head, not the other way around. If Hakeem was on the Magic, it would‚Äôve at least been a 7 game series. It‚Äôs not even like the Rockets cast was that much better than the Magic team. Hakeem dominated the whole series, and there‚Äôs a reason the Knicks took him to 7, whereas the Magic got swept. :) Also I dont know why so many of you are dick riding Shaq lmao, this is Shaq before his prime, not in his prime. Smh. And here‚Äôs a saying for you: Skill always beats brute force; and hard work beats talent when talent doesnt work hard enough. Hakeem is arguably the most skilled player of all time, and Shaq at the point in his career literally only used brute force. Hakeem outskilled him tremendously.	0

"A homeless person after treatment isn't homeless. Its a person in treatment, living in a halfway home perhaps. If you're imagining a ""bum"" off the streets going to a job interview at mcdonalds then you're only thinking in extremes here and not realistically. There are plenty of people who work in mcdonalds who are in treatment: therapy, 12 step program, rehab, you name it. This would be more of the same.   Furthermore, you have to have a better argument than ""being homeless gives you PTSD"". That's not in official literature and the only people who say that as far as I know are people who aren't medical professionals giving their opinion. aka biased takes on the issue.   Your last paragraph is where your opinion clouds your judgement imo. You start off strong by talking about parking spaces. Read this post from 2 years ago to substantiate your knowledge. Read it. https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/6lvwh4/im_an_architect_in_la_specializing_in_multifamily/.   But, your overall main premise is wrong, and I'll tell you why.   The main problem isn't nimbys and blocking homeless shelters, its not giving people with drug addiction and mental illness treatment FIRST. These are diseases of the mind that CANNOT be treated on your own. You need professional help from experienced medical professionals, preferably in a psychiatric setting. Its the same way you need a heart surgeon to perform a bypass surgery on you. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. That's it, bottom line kind of thing.  If you build all the shelters and affordable housing your heart desires (which will never happen btw because the free market controls these things, not govt initiatives) then it will still be a failure because housing is NOT a treatment for schizophrenia or drug addiction. Its a recipe for disaster to give schizophrenics a free house. They'll think govt spies are outside, meaning they'll never leave the house and suffer from malnutrition because they don't go grocery shopping. Many homeless people in their current state CANNOT TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES. They need professional help first before anything else, and you don't understand this because you're only looking at this from a housing POV, which is a failure of perspective.  I've read articles about formerly homeless people being given these houses and they couldn't pay their bills, keep the house clean, or generally hold their shit together. It was a disaster. This was in the NY/NJ area.   You need to stop thinking in terms of housing and nimbys. Its liberal talking points for people who don't know anything about drug addiction or mental health beyond what they read in headlines, which I think you may fall into. I'm lucky enough to be a medical professional so I know a bit more about this, which is where my POV comes from. I've been involved in a psychiatric hospital (on the treatment side) that treated plenty of homeless people, which is why I know how treatment plans work. Everything I described is what I've seen with my own eyes. If I asked you what % of homeless people have drugs in their tox screens, your first guess would always be under what the actual answer is, for example.   I do not mean to denigrate you. You have a lot of great points here. A lot. And you know what you're talking about. I just fave minor disagreements."	0

I think there are positives to testing asyntomatics and weakly-symtomathics group of  the population and not just individual that are symptomatics. I think it is possible that the lethality of this virus is greatly exagerrated by the bias in the testing process and perhaps a more efficient solutions could had been reach if we had understood the virus better. Say for instance, that the virus is only weakly symptomathic or is asyntomathic in a redicolous number such as 99.9999% of under 40s with no pre-condition. If We could somehow just implement social disnancing measures for over 40s and under 40s with pre-conditions and let the virus go through the rest of the population in 3 or 4 weeks without impacting significantly the health system. This would not only reduce economic damage, but it would allow for greater support of our critical industries and a reduction of the risk of exhusting our critical resources, which is the compunding factor of a pandemic.  Of course, such an approach would require much greater precision, and it would require pre-planned and preantive measures. Stratigacally accelerate the curve for subgroup and desaccelerate it for another group, a feat of social-engenering perhaps beyond of what is possible for country like US.  But, a fact is that the economic and social damage of this measures taken by the government are also real, and perhaps for some very large subset of the population the remedy is more harmful than the disease.	0

He was the first unanimous mvp who continued his stellar play until that finals series, he averaged more turnovers than assists as the PG and scored much less than what he was showing in every other part of that season, hows that disingenuous? Name another season or series he had more turnovers than assists  A high turnover player? What stats do you have to back that up lol, he averaged 4.3 TO per game, which is more than any season he‚Äôs had. We both saw that behind the back pass into the stands in a crucial moment of game 7  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs delusional at all, he went from 30.1/5.4/6.7 on 50/45/91 with 3.3 TO per game to 22.6/4.9/3.7 40/40/93 with 4.3 TO per game , that‚Äôs a huge drop off for a unanimous mvp.   Stats don‚Äôt even do it justice, it looked clear when he lost his cool and threw his mouthpiece at a fan. It‚Äôs not hate haha, I like him but I‚Äôm not blindly defending him like yourself	0

Bro you Celtics fans are delusional AF. The Rockets fan is right, and I'm not even a Harden or Rockets fan.  I checked the stats, Harden puts up almost twice as many points, more than twice as many assists, and is assisted on 14.1% of his 3's whereas Tatum is assisted on 61.1% of his 3's.  Harden is a far more efficient volume scorer, putting up far more points on higher percentages from everywhere (Ft, paint, mid 2, long 2), the only place Harden is below Tatum in efficiency is assisted field goals.  Harden also does all this while putting up 35.2 ppg over Tatums 22.2ppg on a higher EFP.  Harden Shooting Stats by distance   .534  .650  .398  .480  .500  .356 (Harden is assisted on .141 of his 3's)  Tatum Shooting Stats by distance   .473  .602  .373  .410  .375  .387 (Tatum is assisted on .611 of his 3's)  Oh and Assist to TOV% 1.64 for Harden and 1.35 for Tatum.  There is practically no comparison between the two players whatsoever.  Harden is a far more efficient scorer and assister with heavy ball usage volume scorer putting up 35.2ppg and 7.3apg.  Tatum is a below average creator, below average shooter, but is an above average catch and shoot 3pt shooter putting up 22.2ppg and 2.9apg.  Oh, and as for consistency, Harden appears to be far more consistent without doing the advanced math, he literally goes 3 months without dropping below 23 points in a game while his FG% sits in the 15.4% and 66.7%. His worst game being 12 points on 13 fg's.  Tatum's consistency is notably worse, his FG% jumps between 5.6% and 80.0%, while his worst game was 5 points on 18 fg's.	1
I think Andrew Wiggins was just a product of his environment. I don‚Äôt think it is a coincidence that everyone that goes to Minnesota ends up unhappy due to the culture of losing. We saw it with KG, Kevin Love, KAT, Butler, and Wiggins. Eventually you have to stop blaming the players and look at who the owners are putting in charge.	1

Plenty plenty of people practice it.  I love using that shot in horse.  Plus it's good to impress kids when you're coaching.   If you play ball long enough and care enough to work out a lot you've probably practiced just about every shot in the book at one time or another.	0

How is it stealing if people agree to pay for the prices?  Y'all are fools.  You tell yourself what you need to tell yourself to make yourself better. But you are in the wrong, no two ways about it.  You have a fundamental misunderstanding of how laborers are paid, and that's fine.   Why do you think cashiers get paid so little? Because the amount of people willing and able to do the work is so fucking high that it doesn't matter what wages they pay, someone will do the work.   This is why improving yourself to make yourself more valuable is important.	0

The Nets are not better with DLo as there #1 in any way. Neither are the Celtics.

At any rate, any sort of attitude problem Kyrie has is far outweighed by being a much better player. There isn‚Äôt a single team in the league that would rather have DLo than Kyrie.	0

Not how life works for me. There‚Äôs a thing called self respect. Also they can bring another chair for Kobe. This was just a move for him to get his rocks off for the power. Same as everyone else who hazes rookies or people ‚Äúunderneath‚Äù them in status. Time we outgrew this habit.	1
I honestly think some of them care a lot about fans, but the majority don't give a fuck. I got to meet Kobe Bryant IRL and he couldn't have been cooler to everyone there. He signed autographs and took pictures for a few hours at a restaurant he ate at after a Timberwolves game. He was super nice to everyone and this was like a month before the Colorado rape thing. I will forever speak positive about Kobe. He was amazing to meet.	0
I would like to see Duncan carry that horrible Minnesota team for 12 years. Garnett was the reason why fans were coming to T-Wolves' games. Never foget that legendary MVP season in 2004. where Garnett carried T-Wolves to the Conference Finals, and if they got past the Pistons, they would meet Lakers in the Finals, and i believe, become NBA champs. He was so great that even Bill Russell said if Garnett didnt win a ring, he would give him one of his. Luckily Garnett won the ring he deserved in 2008. He even came back to Minnesota to play his last season there. We will never see a player like Garnett ever again. Congrats Kevin, you deserve to be in the HOF	0

Lmao the Lakers did sure but I didnt see him fitting in very well if you had actually watched a knicks game you‚Äôd see he ISO‚Äôs and posts up in the high elbow looking for a midrange shot. He‚Äôs a subpar defender and basically just slightly better kuzma. In our system as the third option  I doubt he would be better than he was in Boston. But yeah trading him for kuz and one of the best 3 and D players in the league is definitely a good idea üòÇ	1

Meh I did the math on the wrong year. But tbh I really dont care that harden got roughly 100 more points for the season in an era where scoring is drastically higher than it was in wilts era. Also what did harden win that year? Oh yea an all nba selection. That's it. No mvp. No chip. According to analysts he wasnt even the best player in the nba that year, much less had a better season than the GOAT center...long story short. Harden is not even close to the most valuable player in the nba currently, much less the best ever...go homer him some more, maybe make like a beard subreddit or something so you can go jerk off in a circle with all the other guys that like watching the pace of a game where one player takes 30 free throws.	1
Yeah I get defense, but the gap in offense though, even in the 20 games he played this season, it's enough for me not to say Tatum is better yet, I get that Celtics fans have their own personal biases in that comparison.	1
This is spoken like someone whose never had to deal with anything like this in their lives.  The reason many women feel the way they do about Kobe - or someone accused of these things - is they have seen and lived the real life consequences of these actions.  Someone whose assaulted, and then sees that Kobe passed and everyone is mythologizing him as a legend, free of any critical thinking on who he actually was, is allowed to be upset about it.	1

Seemingly a lot more suburban kids are in the NBA now outside of just kids of ex pros. Didn‚Äôt used to be as common. Also many more foreign players from all backgrounds   But anyway AAU is the same collective scam The NCAA runs but at high school level. It‚Äôs really picked up a ton the last 2 decades. They do events sponsored out the ass by the biggest shoe companies and invite x amount of heralded kids or teams for any given event and do it strenuously enough that many American prospects are known for a long time.   Many of the kids are stars while still in high school now so they have crazy media coverage themselves, it‚Äôs not a rare thing like when Lebron was in HS  The only players you can‚Äôt account for are late bloomers which are pretty common in the NBA, and then all the foreign players in the league now too (outside of the obvious lottery picks) that you can‚Äôt scout as extensively (Jokic and Giannis for example )	0

Most of us are dead or dying, but I guess most would say life is good.  Humans figured out how to not kill each other or the earth‚Äîso on paper we‚Äôre lookin‚Äô great.  Funny little brains we have though‚Äîsure, the bombs don‚Äôt drop anymore, but it seems humans need a common conflict to exist.  We are a restless species.  And, sure enough, we settled on our new common conflict in practically no time at all‚Äîironic, isn‚Äôt that?‚ÄîThat the only thing we can agree on is what to fight over? Like I said‚Äîfunny little brains.  So, yeah, we still have bombs‚Äîof course we do‚Äîwe‚Äôre humans.  The bomb isn‚Äôt forewarned with sirens and followed by twisted flesh anymore though. Now the bomb attacks from within‚Äîuntil half your family, half your friends, half your liver...fuck‚Äîmight as well be half your rotten mind‚Äîthe bomb gets everyone.  A common human conflict just how we like it.  My mother died the night the Bucks won the 2020 championship‚Äîtragic‚Äîon a day that should have been pure joy, my mother died of a broken heart.  That broke everything. It was the last day I ever talked to my father. It was all just to much for him‚Äîthe highs and lows, the money, the slumps‚Äîjust too much. I guess my experience draws some parallels to his too‚Äîstrange as that may sound.  It‚Äôs not special though. We‚Äôre just like every other family, every political party, every book club, every homeowner‚Äîhundreds of millions of families quit on each other over the same thing that week. Pretty quick, people quit on themselves‚Äîleft clinging to their ideals while they slept alone and hardened.  Anyway, I don‚Äôt think I have anything else to say about life. I still don‚Äôt know why you wanted to hear about me. Like I said‚Äîain‚Äôt nothin‚Äô unique ‚Äòbout me. Not since then and not when I die‚Äîwe all die that one way or that other way ever since then‚Äîyou know how it goes.  My father died that one way‚Äîhe left me one thing in his will: a cramped storage unit that was late on rent and filled with trash cans. I didn‚Äôt even have to look‚Äîa I knew what the label on every single damn one of them said: ‚ÄúKhris Middleton.‚Äù  I hope that mean old fuck is burning in hell, because I‚Äôm sure as hell dying that other way‚Äîthe right way‚Äîknowing Khris Middleton was a legitimate second-option superstar and the Bucks would not have won the 2020 NBA championship without him.  Kha$h fuckin‚Äô Money ‚Äòtill my last breath‚Äîwhich should be any minute now, so how ‚Äòbout you let me get back to dying, because I‚Äôve got nothing to prove‚Äîjust like James.	1

You've fallen for MSM lies.  Here‚Äôs the real timeline of what happened (all of this BEFORE we had even one death in the US) :   1/6 CDC issues travel advisory for Wuhan.   1/11 CDC tweets about corona related ‚Äúpneumonia outbreak in China‚Äù   1/14 WHO tweets that there is no evidence of human to human transmission.   1/17 CDC started doing health screenings at 3 airports of travelers from China.   1/21 first case in US for someone who traveled directly from Wuhan.   1/23 WHO again says no human to human transmission outside of China.   1/27 WHO raises alert level but is still saying China has it contained.   1/28 CDC states ‚Äú While CDC considers covid a serious situation and is taking preparedness measures, the immediate risk in the US is considered low.‚Äù   1/29 White House announces Coronavirus Task Force created. Note - this is despite the WHO downplaying the threat!   1/31 Trump bans travel from China. Media and multiple Democrats slam his decision calling it racist/xenophobic. 2/5 Trump acquitted (impeachment).   2/5 Chuck Schumer in a tweet continues to call Trumps‚Äô travel ban from China ‚Äúpremature.‚Äù   2/7 White House‚Äôs Coronavirus Task Force gives press briefing.   2/9 White House Coronavirus Task Force meets with all governors regarding virus.   2/12 CDC waiting for approval from Chinese for CDC team to travel to China.   2/18 HHS announces partnership to develop vaccine.   2/21 Italy identifies its very first case in their country.   2/21 CDC tweets that it is working with States for preparedness.   2/24 Trump sent letter to Congress asking for $25B for virus effort.   2/24 Nancy Pelosi made a stop in Chinatown and encouraged people to ‚Äúplease come and visit and enjoy Chinatown.‚Äù   2/25 there is still no reported community spread in the US!!! (Per CDC tweet.)   2/27 first community transmission in US.   2/27 Trump appoints Pence to coordinate efforts.   2/29 FIRST reported Covid19 death in US.   It is helpful to look at the actual timeline. All of this happened BEFORE the 1st death in US.	0

I just have to go on a quick rant about how dumb and gullible NBA fans are. So I saw people bring this back up several times last night cuz of the game that was played on ESPN last night. If you truly believe Green called KD in the parking lot and begged for him to join, not only are you a fkn retard but you are very gullible. If you just think to yourself for 30 seconds, the story makes zero sense. How would the media find out about this cuz I highly doubt Green nor KD would tell a media member and I highly doubt a teammate would snitch on Green. That whole story was made up to create drama and a storyline and you gullible sheep believed it. Just like you believe everything the media says even tho 99% of it is fake news. The NBA media has the fans on strings since they are a bunch of clueless and very gullible puppets	0
Heat won zero titles and.lebron has zero titles in years that his teams beat rose.  Zero. Rose didn't play for the bulls in 2012 or 2013. So no, LeBron didn't win any titles at the bulls expense with their star players playing.  His titles have asterisks. You're a moron to not think so	0

Almost everything you said was wrong. Scottie played the 2nd most minutes in that knicks series to put them in the ECF his 2nd year.

That is how they got to the eastern conference finals. The year before when Scottie was a rookie they didn‚Äôt make it out of the 2nd round. Scottie was 4 year college player.

Whoever votes for LeBron is literally a biased retard.

Vince was an elite player for 10 years and a very good player and legitimately important piece for the Magic and Mavs. The NJ, Orlando, and Dallas teams were highly competitive and just didn't quite have the same firepower that a few other teams had during his prime years. I believe he should be a Hall of Famer, although he will never be regarded in the same light as other greats of his era, and rightfully so. He strikes me as the Superstar-esque tier. During his true prime you had guys like KG, Kobe, Dirk, Duncan, Tmac, etc. that were on the truly elite level,  he was second tier, but that doesn't mean he wasn't great.	0

>I should have said Lakers instead  That's fair; I pull no punches when it comes to talking about the Lakers but honestly, it's no worse than what I've seen Laker fans say about the Lakers in their own team sub.  And if it makes you feel better, I used to do the same thing to the Warrior fans as well, but they've noticeably disappeared this year.  >no better than someone thinking x is paid by Ballmer.  This is exactly one of them. I've read comments that have mentioned how Kawhi and Collison screwed you guys over. I've read comments about how Ballmer is paying Moe Harkless to not ask for a buyout to prevent him from going to the Lakers. I've read comments about how Ballmer probably paid Collison to lie to the Lakers and trick them into thinking he was coming so they'd make no moves at the deadline.  So if we're just blindly throwing out accusations, might as well join the party.	1
Every superstar gets hate, for some reason.   But on top of that, Curry rose to superstardom during LeBron‚Äôs prime. Instead of having 5 or 6 rings and being the undisputed GOAT, LeBron has an abysmal 3-6 finals record which is really the main argument for him being ranked below Jordan.   Curry‚Äôs rise prevented LeBron from being recognized as the greatest ever across the NBA community. I think there‚Äôs a lot of resentment stemming from Bronsexuals for that.	0

Simmons. I think his ceiling is simply higher. I also think that even as is, a team with him as it‚Äôs centerpiece could win more.

Yeah what a lot of it comes down to is this paternalistic bullshit from many males who pretend they know/care what‚Äôs best for women when they say ‚Äúoh you can‚Äôt hire a women because players and men are so sexist it‚Äôll be brutal for them they shouldn‚Äôt be considered hence!!‚Äù. I‚Äôm not referring specifically to who you are replying to but as a general point, Lol someone like Becky Hammond knows more about the nba locker room and culture than fans do.   If she thinks it‚Äôs too sexist an environment that the team wouldn‚Äôt be rrady for a head coach and hence she doesn‚Äôt want the position her coming to that decision is understandable. But that doesn‚Äôt appear to be what‚Äôs happening and yet many still insist ‚Äúit‚Äôs unfair to her to even consider her a candidate and let her subject herself to misogyny!!‚Äù. As if misogyny is going away anytime soon and that the people actually facing it shouldn‚Äôt be the ones who decide whether a situation poses too much of it that‚Äôs it‚Äôs not worth dealing with for them	1

I remember nearly throwing my phone when Dwight got waived multiple times. He wasn't prime Dwight, but he literally just put up a 32/30 game.   I've seen worse players get play time, let alone waived off a vet min. People have a hatred for centers now, and an ever bigger hatred for defensive end players. The years of Rodman superstars are gone. Just the other day people were saying Draymond Green was a terrible defender and player.   Even being the best defenders in NBA history no longer makes you safe.	0
Curry is above harden.. Klay is above trae young , jokic etc.. game 6 klay is the first scoring option even with kd and curry on the team.. klay gets hot, they tear all plays and defer to him..Trae young's scoring doesnt lead to wins.. besides klay is a better defender than trae will ever be	0

Doubt you will look into this, you'll probably just keep your head in the sand. 2009, 4g roll out. Swine Flu outbreak. 3g rolled out in 2001 - SARS outbreak 2002. Radio towers massively rolled out.

Do you see a pattern? It may be nothing, but it is absolutely a pattern worth looking at.  The WHO seems radio frequency radiation as carcinogenic.  5G is used in WEAPON SYSTEMS for crowd control. 5G¬†Network Uses Same EMF Waves As Pentagon¬†Crowd Control¬†System. ...

"Anfernee Simons is a young guy for whom many had high hopes, but has underperformed this season. At one point in the season, he was the first guard off the bench, but this place has been taken by Gary Trent, who has shown much better shooting and defense for the TrailBlazers. Coach Stotts has taken to staggering Dame and CJ's minutes rather than rely on this rather raw PG to run the offense.  But before we give up on him, there are three things to remember. First, he is very, very young for a second year player. He's only 20, but looks about 16. Secondly, he is physically gifted with great ""hops"" and sufficient quickness. And finally, he is playing behind a couple of the best, most cerebral PGs in the league, players who are known for their intelligence and willingness to help others achieve.  Of course, playing behind Dame and CJ could retard his development as well. He has never really been called to be ""the Man"" except for one unusual game at the end of last season. But if you are looking for someone with high potential but has been written off lately, you could do worse than taking a flyer on Anfernee."	1

"I asked Sam Smith the other day about Jordan's response to him personally regarding the ""Jordan Rules"" for anyone curious about what he actually said (and not the ramblings of a whiny little 12 year old above).  > I've never once spoken with him about the book. He's never said anything to me about the book. When it came out in 1991, it was very controversial. He was upset about the book - I had my doubts that he ever read it, truthfully - but he was upset with the reaction to it. At the time one of his fears was that if things came out and people changed their opinion of him and didn't like him anymore. My sense was that he thought this might or could lead to that. But I was still working for the Tribune and I was still on the beat, and still going to be there.  > The first time Jordan was in the locker room after the book came out I came up to him. I'd been an investigate reporter before going into sports writing and my editor taught me that you have to stand by a difficult story to go up to your subjects. So I went up to him - he didn't look at me, he was in the locker room sorting through tickets.  > So I said to him ""If you have any questions, anything you want to talk about, I'm here"". He didn't say anything so I went to interview other players. I would not have won any kind of battle with Michael Jordan, and to his credit he never made an issue about it, answered my questions and was still professional. We had a good relationship before that - been to dinner, invited to his room to play cards a few times, and that was over after the Jordan Rules.  > But when he came back from his first retirement in 95, he was fine. Had a few one-on-one interviews, got to know him again, and we've spoken in Charlotte. We have a good relationship and he's been nothing but professional.  > But he's never once mentioned the book, never talked about it, never said anything positive or negative to me about it."	1

"...and then they revolted again and again until finally establishing a system that stuck. That's the point. Nobody's saying that the people who took over after the Bourbons were paragons of virtue.  The French revolutions lessened religious interference in politics, reshaped land ownership and did away with tithes and religious taxation that kept the farmers eternally poor, inspired the destruction of multiple oligarchies which led to economic boom across Europe and laid the groundwork for multiple modern ideologies. It was worth the struggle.  We're literally living in a timeline where the American government is openly debating how many workers are worth killing to make sure the rich don't get slightly less rich.

"Names themselves are never racist, sexist, etc. in isolation. The word ""faggot"" itself is not homophobic, and ""bitch"" is not misogynistic. It's how those words have transformed over time to demonize specific groups of people that make them bad. In other words, context matters.  The context here is that people are being attacked because people inexplicably falsely equivocate ""Chinese Virus"" to mean people of Chinese descent have it and carry into their neighborhoods.   I guarantee you if MERS were ravaging America right now we would also see a movement to refer to it by its scientific name EMC-2012 as well and instead of Asians, it would be Middle Easterns being vilified (again, or still). And I would be all for it instead of defending xenophobic rhetoric on reddit because it literally wouldn't hurt me to do so and maybe save a life or two in the process.  You have actual redditors in this very thread talking about how their lives are being affected by this type of rhetoric that emboldens racists. Posts like yours that deflect and miss the forest for the trees doesn't make things any better.  > not a reason to call somebody a racist  The past 3.5 years aside, the POTUS speaks on behalf of all Americans, does he not? If there is rhetoric that instigates violence against Americans, should he use it? Just because the word itself is just a synonym doesn't make it okay."	0

">People think that it's supposed to be this miracle of science, a perfect shield against one of the most mutable viruses in existence. It's not.  No one thinks it's a perfect shield. But it's essentially a ""if you can help yourself and possibly prevent yourself from coming down with the flu,"" then why not get the vaccine. There's very rarely a serious reaction to the vaccine unless you have an egg allergy, but I don't even think this an issue anymore in the inactivated flu vaccine over the live attenuated.  People shouldn't look at the flu vaccine as a 'damned if you do, damned if you don't"" option. The researchers who develop the vaccine rely heavily on epidemiological data and attempt to 'beat the flu' to the punch, so that by time the virus has spread to the US, in this case, people have received the vaccine and developed a strong immunity to it.  But as you've pointed out, the flu can mutate/undergo antigenic shift so that the annual strain is different year in, year out. It's not a perfect solution.  But stating:  >Healthy adults in their prime don't need it.  is really not helpful and severely understates the vaccine's effectiveness."	1

Dude cmon. Like, sure, he shouldn't have called you unemployed.  But everything else you put down is just ridiculous. You use Curry as an example because he hardly dunks? Nobody in the history of the WNBA takes and makes the type of shots Curry does. That's a terrible example.   I don't like watching woman's basketball. Doesn't make me an unathletic, unappreciative idiot. It just means that it doesn't entertain me and/or I'd rather watch or do something else.	0

"> ‚Äúthey [Europeans] just learn how to play basketball while our guys [Americans] learn how to dunk and put together mixtapes.‚Äù  This is only racist if you want to think of it that way, but ignoring race altogether this statement is not wrong **if you generalize** which Cuban did  AAU basketball has definitely turned us into a culture of running and dunking. This is not racist. Mac McClung was a phenom on the highlight circuit because of his dunking ability and he's white. I can show you lists of other playlists of these 5 star prospects running and dunking. That's not seen in europe like it is here, and no this isn't racist this is just factua. The big name high school players are the ones running and dunking in AAU ball   ON the contrary overseas players are frequently seen as being 'skilled' more often than american players. Sure there are exceptons but look at most european big men"": they are great passers, they shoot free throws well, and they have overall basketball savviness. The Gasols, Jokic, Sabonis, Vucevic, it goes on and on. This is not seen as much as it is in American centers. How many american born centers do you see with this craftiness? Obviously they have these skills to *some* degree but in European players they tend to show better basketball 'skills' than do the likes of Drummond, Dedmon, Whiteside, Okafor, Howard, McGee   you are trying too hard to make it a race issue"	1

"> It's annoying that they're dismissive  Dismissive of what? I think maybe how they're categorizing it is what bothers you?   > I don't know if they realize that roughly half my male friends are gay.  That's not possible unless you basically only socialize within a gay community? Gays comprise less than 5% of the world's population.  > They specifically called it ""weird"" and weren't as intense as banning it from discussion.  Again, I think it's just the terminology they're using that bothers you since ""weird"" has a certain connotation to it that you're sensitive too.  Like I said before, if you want to keep things technical... homosexuality is considered *abnormal* behavior. However, it does exist in nature.. thus it is *natural* to an extent.  Maybe you can tell your parents the above so at least your conversations about the subject can be termed correctly?"	1

Yao was also a superhuman created by the Chinese government. They bred the tallest woman in China (the Chinese   basketball captain) with one of the tallest men in China (dad was 6'7).  Essentially he was practicing basketball under watch of the government since he was 5. It's some Gattaca shit. They knew he was going to be tall so they basically had him do shooting drills for practice. He came out extremely well rounded as a result, but since humans aren't supposed to grow that tall, his bones couldn't take it. NBA scouts had definitely heard of Yao growing up though, I guarantee it  [Article](https://www.smh.com.au/sport/basketball/yao-ming-the-basketball-giant-made-in-china-by-order-of-the-state-20060119-gdmsz0.html)	0

Reggie Miller. I can't believe nobody has mentioned him yet. Dude was one of the first I ever saw doing it as a shooter and getting far in the playoffs. He dared to even get to the NBA Finals and hang 2 games up on Shaq and Kobe at the beginning of their 3 peat. One of the few who pushed Jordan to 7 games in a series. I'm not sure that anyone besides Detroit did that. In an era dominated by big centers and forwards, he was the first straight up shooter type to be winning 50-60+ games with his shooting style being the dominant threat. He was a tough SOB too and I think he'd tear this league up right now. He was always a playoff performer and is one of the few that turned up his play in the playoffs. He didn't average 40ppg like MJ did, but Reggie had a playoff gear where other guys just simply did not.	0

Curry without even blinking. People look at cp3's assists and say he is a better facilitator but i believe curry is a better facilitator who doesnt care about personal stats. Warriors offense run by curry generates the highest number of assists. If u count curry's hockey assists u will realise his playmaking skills is beyond what the score sheet reflects. A PG should be able to make his team mates better and curry has done exactly that.. if draymond was playing with CP3 would he ever be an all star?. Why is it that almost all cp3's ex team mates hate him. I heard stories that he passes the ball to teammates with the shot clock winding down to avoid taking the turnover..Curry has no issue with team mates and coaches which is even as important in winning as on court plays.. more efficient scorer, great facilitator, great team mate.. Curry all day	0

You can make the argument that his 2011 playoff performance completely shed his reputation as a playoff choker. His career prior to that had seen his team:  - blow a 2-0 lead in the 2006 Finals - lose as the 1-seed in the first round in 2007 (first time that had happened in a best-of-7 series) - lose as the 2-seed in the first round in 2010 (first time that had happened in a best-of-7 series)  If you go back and watch his highlights from that postseason (particularly against the Thunder and Heat), I believe it undid all the damage done from those earlier years.	0

"> You do realize that teams have an opportunity to offer an extension before a player hits Free Agency right?  That's how the NBA works.  I get that you're new to this.  The Celtics DIDN'T offer an extension.  Not that they couldn't, they simply didn't.  They moved on from Kyrie and his toxic personality. You claimed that they ""waited"" for Kyrie and moved on to Kemba. Now you're admitting that you made that up?  [According to Lowe, the Boston Celtics would have offered star point guard Kyrie Irving an extension last fall ‚Äúbut rules capped Irving‚Äôs first-year salary in such a deal at 120% of his 2018-19 salary ‚Äî well short of what he stood to make by entering unrestricted free agency.‚Äù As a result, the Celtics knew that it would be all but impossible to convince Irving to sign the extension, a scenario that‚Äôs a common happenstance in the NBA.](https://celticswire.usatoday.com/2019/07/24/report-celtics-would-have-offered-kyrie-irving-an-extension-last-fall/)   Let me guess, Zach Lowe is lying too?  > You've provided 0 facts.

Wade no doubt. This isn‚Äôt even a question.

His playoff efficiency ALWAYS drastically dipped compared to the regular season and he always had his worse series in the biggest games and moments   KD **WISHES** he could have have the run Dwade had in 2006   Put Dwade on those warriors teams instead of KD and they would have gone 16-0, 16-1 in both of their playoff runs  Put Trevor Ariza on those teams instead of KD and they still win at least 1 title lol that‚Äôs how stacked KDs team was   If this was asked in 2016 it would be overwhelmingly wade.

Kareem is lucky he peaked in the crack-infested '70s or he would have faced the same fate running into the Celtic dynasty year after year. He also became quite frail in his mid '30s, never averaging 10 rebounds a game or more from age 34 on. Surely a point of saltiness when compared to Wilt's greatness.  Ultimately, Wilt is *the* reason why Kareem is not looked at as the greatest, at immortality. How can you be if you're not even the greatest of your position?	1

This is classic Kyrie though... and it's the side of Kyrie that hasn't gotten any attention by the media or the fans at large.   Kyrie doesn't just go after his teammates. He throws them under the bus when **he** has a bad game.    [Here's part of one of my older comments:](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/e2sdk3/kyrie_has_some_choice_words_for_celtics_fans/f8xmk1x/)  ***  Kyrie spent the last season trashing the people around him every time he had a bad game. r/nba needs to go back and watch those games where he was lashing out. Pretty much every single time he spoke negatively about his team was when he was the one having a bad game.  Take the Charlotte game in March. We had a 10 point lead in the fourth before Kyrie subbed in.    * Here's Kyrie going 1/5 in the final quarter ([1](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=594&Season=2018-19&title=MISS%20Irving%2030%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&sct=plot), [2](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=625&Season=2018-19&title=Irving%202%27%20Driving%20Layup%20\(31%20PTS\)&sct=plot), [3](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=627&Season=2018-19&title=MISS%20Irving%2028%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&sct=plot), [4](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=632&Season=2018-19&title=MISS%20Irving%2026%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&sct=plot), [5](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=666&Season=2018-19&title=MISS%20Irving%2026%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&sct=plot)) * Here he is with the turnover, 0 assists for the quarter btw ([1](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=639&Season=2018-19&title=Irving%20Lost%20Ball%20Turnover%20\(P3.T11\)&sct=plot)) * Here he is just ball-watching and oblivious to where his man is ([1](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=586&Season=2018-19&title=MISS%20Walker%2010%27%20Fadeaway%20Jumper&sct=plot), [2](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=624&Season=2018-19&title=Walker%202%27%20Driving%20Layup%20\(29%20PTS\)&sct=plot)) * Here he is not making the effort to contest Kemba's shot ([1](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=576&Season=2018-19&title=MISS%20Walker%2026%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&sct=plot), [2](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=612&Season=2018-19&title=Walker%2026%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot%20\(27%20PTS\)&sct=plot)) * Here's Kyrie's fouls, mostly from playing lazy and not being in position ([1](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=600&Season=2018-19&title=Irving%20L.B.FOUL%20\(P2.T3\)%20\(M.Callahan\)&sct=plot), [2](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=634&Season=2018-19&title=Irving%20P.FOUL%20\(P3.T4\)%20\(B.Taylor\)&sct=plot), [3](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=641&Season=2018-19&title=Irving%20S.FOUL%20\(P4.PN\)%20\(M.Callahan\)&sct=plot), [4](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=657&Season=2018-19&title=Irving%20P.FOUL%20\(P5.PN\)%20\(B.Taylor\)&sct=plot))   And that's all in just the 4th quarter...   Guess what he had to say to the media afterward:  > ‚ÄúThe game was over in the beginning of the fourth quarter,‚Äù Irving told reporters. ‚ÄúWe took our foot off the gas pedal; it got to a five-point game, momentum shifted from there.‚Äù >  > He was then asked what does the team talk about following a game like this, one in which the Celtics had an 18-point lead in the fourth quarter only to allow the Hornets to close out the game with a 30-5 run.  >  > ‚ÄúBeing more mature down the stretch,‚Äù Irving said.  >  > ... >  > ‚ÄúJudge us when we have our full lineup,‚Äù Irving said. ‚ÄúBut obviously when we come out and play like this with a bunch of young guys down the stretch, figuring things out ‚Ä¶ things are bound to happen but there‚Äôs no excuses.‚Äù  ***  This isn't about Jarrett Allen at all.   This is about Kyrie looking for a scapegoat after he went 6/21 (14 points) and had a -29 (worse than all teammates combined) for the night.   The media might not pick up on this, but make no mistake, the guys in the locker room will.	1

Scottie‚Äôs defense and gravity allowed them to beat the Knicks. Without him they might have lost.

Lmao, bro this isn't mortal combat. You got medical staff, refs, judges the whole bit. All these people are around other people who go around other people. If a judges wife gets the covid and passes it to someone else it's just a huge chain reaction. I think we can go a few months without watching a couple of people beat each other up for our entertainment.  This is some Roman empire shit where we are all so arrogant and selfish it leads to our collapse right before our eyes.	1

Lmao retard, you didn't answer anything because you don't know the answer.  Play style is literally directly effected because of rules, how fucking old are you?  Edit: also, it's a sticking point because you're arguing that someone would play better than others, when you really don't even know how well he would play. You think players from today wouldn't be able to play in his era, but you don't even know how well he played in his era.	0

"> And don't tell me I don't know about economics systems and history lmao... I can guarantee you I'm well more learned on this topic than you.  Oh boy lol  You're an idiot. I was going to respond with some stats to blow your mind, that Michigan in fact is far better in standard of living than the rest of the world, but I am realizing you are probably a troll and just wasting time.   I get you're insecure about your financial future but putting your hands over your ears and yelling ""bIlLiOnAiRrEs bAd"" isn't going to help. At the end of the day hyper capitalism has made improvements that vastly outweigh the negatives that come along with it. Nordic countries, and Canada greatly benefit from a lot of the innovation, and production that happened in the US, by profit seeking individuals. It is not the reserve currency for the rest of the world for no reason. For someone very learned on this topic you seem to not know much at all.   Canadian btw and while I love our healthcare system, I am not retarded enough to ignore the obvious benefits of capitalism and even aggressive capitalism. We directly benefit from their private medical sector where we can benefits from their developments in technology and medicine without any of the R&D costs. Unlike you I at least recognize the benefits of socialism, where your arguments are coming from some deep insecurity where you want to pretend profit seeking motive is fundamentally terrible."	0
Are you asking how to explain it biologically? Cause basically what happens is you start in the womb with two X chromosomes. We all start out female. Then at a certain point in the development we go through a certain process where ducts open and certain hormones are released. Testosterone if you are a boy, estrogen (i think or it might be a different hormone) if you are a girl   But sometimes there are issues with the transformation. And a defect is created where there is an imbalance in the brain biology and body biology leading to an lgbtq person. So yes a gay person is biologically gay. It's just a defect of their body attempting to fit into the male or female role  Ps for anyone who is going to downvote me for explaining this you should know I have actually studied this so if you haven't actually studied this then you can't anger down vote me	1

Sorry, but this just isn't the case. As much as I'd like it to be true, watching the Mystics and Seattle is truly an inferior product. I watched all 3 games of the WNBA Finals to really give it a chance, mostly because people were advocating it hard. I think it was all paid media or white knights that was driving that enthusiasm, because what I saw was not it.  They repeatedly turned the ball over in crunch time in Game 2... maybe Game 3 . The most egregious example was in the 4th Q was there were multiple 5 second inbound violations by both teams and I'm pretty sure there was an instance where both teams had 5 second violations back-to-back. The following possession, Elle Delle Donne (?) missed a wide-open bunny layup.  It was just a sloppy game to watch. If any NBA team played like this they would be crucified. Even the sloppiest NCAA March Madness game really couldn't compare to this product. Wish that wasn't the reality, and I expect the WNBA to improve, but it still has a long long way to go.	1

"Oh hell yeah brother, I totally hear you! Really like your description, and I would even go as far to say Dirks ring is THE most valuable off all time (at least that I have witnessed).  But i also think the KD narrative is greatly overblown, Steph was still just as impactful in those playoffruns and I just can't fault someone for bringing in the 2nd best player in the league when you have the chance to do so.  And if you go with the Asterisk for his first then you have to start putting one to every single other title (like Lebrons the year after, because of the Green suspension).  In short I firmly believe Stephs 3 rings combined outweigh Dirks, although I will admit, ""greatly"" may just be a tad bit too much."	0

I mean, there‚Äôs definitely been other bad presidents. I don‚Äôt like Trump, but he‚Äôs not any worse than the others, he‚Äôs just worse at not getting caught. Anyone who works their way to that position is covering some very, VERY sketchy things. He‚Äôs just the worst at hiding them. Everyone who has a firm belief in a politician has to overlook things. It‚Äôs a matter of what things someone can overlook. Some people can overlook the racism because it lines their pockets. Some people were able to overlook Obama jailing whistle blowers because it furthered their agenda, and people were able to overlook Bush‚Äôs non-reaction then subsequent over reaction to 9/11, Clinton getting a hummer, Regan selling weapons against Congress‚Äô wishes and so on, because it furthers their plots. My point is they‚Äôre all terrible. Not one single politician is out to help the people. The ones who say they are, are not. If they were, they would be doing something positive with their time and their life instead of driving a wedge into society over partisan politics.  They‚Äôre out to make a buck, like we all are. The problem is their dollar comes at the expense of roughly half the people they represent.	0

">""You look amazing"", said Mitchell, hands on his skinny jeans that barely skim his butt cheeks. Only Donovan could pull off something that sexy and still look classy. ""Come on, let's dance"", said Gobert, pulling Mitchell over to a minuscule space directly in front of his line of vision. ""You're a great dancer"", said Gobert in gruff tones, ""Champagne?"", Donovan pretends to hesitate ""Of course"" he says. Gobert takes Mitchell's hand and walks up to his room, where an ice bucket and a bottle of Laurent Perrier await. He pours out some glasses, toasting ""To the most beautiful shooting guard in the room"". The truth is, Donovan is more than happy to keep flirting; he is incredibly attracted to Gobert, with his intense brown eyes and his ripped body. Mitchell lets out a sigh that's completely genuine, as Gobert pushes him into the bed, he notices four wide, black silk ribbons are tied to the bed frame. Gobert leans down and kisses Mitchell, his lightly stubbled cheek brushing against Donovan's nipples. He takes the right nipple in his hand and rubs it under his thumb as he bites down gently, teasingly."	1

How will quarantine increase the duration of this pandemic? If people are inside and not in contact there will be less cases, hence, with time, it'll go away. If we all stayed inside for the next month without leaving our homes once, it would go away because there wouldn't be more infections.  If you know that you playing basketball doesn't help this situation and could be putting people at risk if in touch with them, why are you still doing it? We all know it's hard to stay home for a long period of time but the longer we adjourn this isolation, the longer the virus will be around (contrary to what you've been stating), just make an effort, for the sake of everyone else that is doing that effort, to be careful. You can take all precautions but if you're playing Basketball with someone that is infected (and you can't know for sure who is and isn't) all those precautions are just wasted.	0

You shouldn't believe anything. Don't believe propaganda or illogical media telling you what to believe. There are enough whistleblowers out there saying covid is being marked on patients that died who clearly did not have it that you should at least use common sense to doubt what you are being told.  What were we told at first? MILLIONS COULD DIE. 65m Americans might die.  They have to falsify literally every person in ICU that they can, and the numbers are still pathetically low lol.  I'd be all over the hate Gobert bandwagon, if this was actually the plague or something. Right now this all seems ridiculously fishy, and no one will probably have a clue what the truth is.  Maybe they are doing it to reset the economy, to gather data about the environment, et cetera. And maybe they are just grabbing more power. Nobody knows. What we do know is that covid is not even close to what the fearmongers were saying, and there are multiple studies out there that say staying at home, with so many exceptions like we are now, doesn't even help.	0

"> No they don't lol, you don't know what you're talking about  No 5 footers in the last All Star game.   Isaiah Thomas the hero of manlets has already been kicked out of the NBA for being shit.  > Jokic is one of the best passers in the league, leads the league in game winners, and is already the best passing center of all time.  There are 3 billion 5 footers in the world and you are going to tell me that not a single one of them is better than that bum?  Very easy to pass the ball when you see everyone from above and it's hard as fuck to block you because you are 7 foot tall.  >  Thon Maker is a good example. He is athletic and is said to have a great work ethic by everyone, but he's mediocre.  Quick Google search: ""When he was 14, Maker was discovered by Edward Smith...   At first, Maker was reluctant to leave the soccer field behind to focus on organized basketball... At that time Thon was spending his time playing soccer, and had never played basketball a day in his life.""  ""I said no, not because of him, but just I didn‚Äôt want to play basketball,"" Maker explained. ""But after trusting in him and going along with the plan, he said, 'Trust me, trust me.'""   Another case of a Soccer reject being told to pursue a Basketball career because Basketball is easy money for very tall dudes... Holy shit there are many many cases of lazy very tall people choosing Basketball for easy money.  Thon Maker is a lazy dude, he couldn't make it in soccer, a sport where you can make a decent living in thousands of teams (each team has like 22 players)... Yet, he quit and switched to Basketball at the age of 14 and is earning millions in the NBA already even if he doesn't give a fuck about the sport.  > The reason the other antetokounmpo brothers have contracts is so teams can lure in Giannis.  The NBA is the dumbest shit ever haha.  > By the way, Giannis is known for having a crazy work ethic lol.  A European Soccer reject has crazy work ethic... Holy shit, if you think a bum like him has work ethic then that explains why the US sucks at European sports like Rugby and Soccer. You have no idea what work ethic means mate.  > you also need to understand that even soccer players require a lot of natural talent. Every single sport requires natural talent and athleticism to compete at the top. Messi is insanely quick and coordinated. Ronaldo is one of the most athletic guys on the planet. Basketball isn't much different.  That's insulting, you will never see rejects form other sports making it to the top of Soccer, let alone reject from other sports that were developed by countries with no soccer infrastructure.  Messi and Ronaldo started to play Soccer at age 4 and worked their assess off, they left their families behind at the age of 11 to go the Barcelona academy (Messi) and Sporting Lisbon (Ronaldo), that's work ethic... They are at the top because of hard work, Messi and Ronaldo are not gifted athletes, Messi looks like a retard and Ronaldo looked like this at the age of 18 [before and after](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/huUuBVRPTKk/maxresdefault.jpg)  It's insulting to compare Giannis, a soccer reject who switched to Basketball late in life to make easy money with Messi and Ronaldo, the hardest workers in sports.  Basketball is based on being tall, sports like soccer are based on hard work, skills and sports IQ."	0

He‚Äôs a better scorer, better playmaker and even a better defender. Him saying mean words that hurt your feelsies doesn‚Äôt change that.  I urge you to make a thread asking ‚Äúwould you rather have Kyrie or DLo on your team‚Äù. I promise you nobody will pick DLo. Just like no front office would pick DLo. Just like the Nets didn‚Äôt pick DLo.

First of all, no one is making any comparison but you; I only brought up Harden because no one else would make the same defense for Harden, making op's entire statement hypocritical. Second, Doncic flops a ton and I like how you just casually waive the fact that he's 5th in the league. He also has a very good fta per fga/drive ratio, not to mention 9.1 fta per 20.4 FGA which is extremely high even if it doesn't quite reach Harden levels.	1

Hey man! So awesome! I was a SLAM reader/subscriber from the late 90's until about 2009 or so. I'm from Hawaii, and I remember there have been a few high school players from Hawaii written about during that time.  Would it be possible to look some up? Some names would include Julian Sensley, Derrick Low, Bobby Nash and all those guys would have been from around 1999-2002 or so. If you don't mind taking a snapshot of whatever is written on those it would be much appreciated!	0

With the Pacers leading 97‚Äì82 and less than a minute left in the game, Pistons [center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(basketball)) [Ben Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Wallace) attempted a layup shot but was fouled hard from behind by Pacers SF Ron Artest, now known as [Metta World Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metta_World_Peace). A furious Wallace then shoved Artest, and the benches emptied; a fight broke out on the court between players of both teams. After the fight was broken up, a fan threw a drink from the stands at Artest while he was lying on the scorer's table to cool himself down. Artest immediately charged after the fan, sparking a massive brawl between players and spectators that stretched from the seats down to the court and lasted several minutes.

[Mod Post] New Mod Application Thread  It's that time of the year again and we're looking for new mods!  In particular, we are looking for mods to assist our team with further automating subreddit processes. We are also looking for mods to help remove/approve posts and answer modmail.   Please answer these questions in your comment.  * What timezone do you currently live in? Central   * What are your normal reddit operating hours? I am available most of the time as a student I look through reddit throughout the day.   * Roughly how much time do you spend on /r/nba on a daily basis? Probably my top 3 subs I use so a lot of the time I‚Äôm scrolling through r/nba   * How long have you been a part of our community and why do you think you'd be a good addition to the mod team? I‚Äôve been on r/nba a few years now and enjoy it a lot. I think it‚Äôs one of the most progressive subs especially for sports.   * If there's one thing you could change about /r/nba, what would that be? Probably more clear rules on why things are getting taken down.   * What is your favorite NBA memory? When Steven Adams missed a free throw on purpose to give it to Russ for the 3.  * Do you have any experience with CSS? Not really but I pick up on things fast.   * Do you have any experience with PRAW or python? Feel free to link anything you have created using them. I use python for classes. I‚Äôm in engineering so it‚Äôs mostly for math needs.  * Do you have any experience hosting python script? No but I can learn  * Are you interested in helping mod the sub discord? Yes   Basketball is my favorite sport and without it I‚Äôd have a lot less entertainment in my life   The rest is up to you guys. Feel free to add anything else that you think might help make a case for why you should be a moderator for /r/nba.  All unrelated comments will be removed for sake of readability. Keep in mind that the amount of upvotes you get in this thread will not have an impact on your application. Please direct all questions to the sticky comment.	1

Probably to save face. MJ is so idolized that to say another man destroyed you like that wouldn‚Äôt do any good. He was 18 when he came here, Got picked by the GOAT himself, and got called a faggot for not living up to expectations and messing up in practice.   I couldn‚Äôt imagine getting my dream job at 18 and being hand picked by the greatest in that field and constantly being broke down like that by said man. It‚Äôll make you hate your job and never live up to expectations. Kwame was put in a really bad position at a bad age and never recovered. Some people just don‚Äôt have the mental fortitude to.	0

"Honestly I've never gotten that connotation from the use of it if it's used ""correctly"". It's just pointing out that something being said literally sounds gay lol. It isn't homophobic to me at all unless you REALLY go out of your way to use it on things that don't even make sense. Is it kinda lame these days? Sure, but that's a different thing.  I'm not someone who ever really used it, but it's a far cry from saying fag or something."	0
It's wierd how instead of addressing any of his specific points you took a bunch of wierd shots at mystery commentors  &#x200B;  > Because a lot of the people that worship analytics   *worship?* Huh? You've figured out how much they weigh these how?  > never actually played at at least a JV level to really understand the nuances of the sport   How do you know how much they've played? And more importantly, why do you need to play JV  basketball to understand the nuances of the sport? Surely if their analysis is so bad, you'd be able to rebut it.  > you gotta bunch of kids    You know their age how?   > everyone else on the team sucks and that player is a volume scorer.   Ohhh, now I get it. You have zero clue how these analytics work. Many stats ***dont*** get inflated with volume scoring. Some prefer players who score less. Now all of what you've said makes sense. You don't know what you're talking about so you're tryna feel yourself by attacking the credibility of people you feel stupider then.   &#x200B;  It's really simple, if someone doesn't know  enough, then you should be able to take apart their arguments. If you can't, then any questions/assumptions you make about that person is probably just self-projection.	0

Of course, when we made the decision, we felt that while Game Threads are very much the same game to game (title straight forward, body straight forward, posted an hour before tip). Post Game Threads are where the community can be involved and add a little flavor. The other benefit, is the most reliable way for a bot to know when a game is done is through the NBA API, which for timing purposes is not always consistent, and results in a delay in posting, which human posters do not have that issue. This is one of the reasons why we have mods post the Post Game Threads during the playoffs, when a place to have instant reactions are in high demand. So basically we felt there were enough benefits to leaving PGTs as is to warrant leaving them alone. Obviously this is an issue, that is possible, and while we've encountered before, it was pretty limited in occurrences, so if we can maintain that, that would be ideal.	1

I am sorry not everyone has all the time in the world like your unemployed ass to watch your town's local basketball games or U17 female basketball games.  People watch NBA cause they know it is the highest quality basketball they will watch on the planet.  And keeping up with the players and analysts (even the click-bait ones like Skip) cause its fun. Watching a WNBA game or heck even college mens game just is not fun for most people, like 80% of basketball fans dont take part in March Madness.

I never said anything about Westbrook nor did I say or imply it was the entirety of this sub. It's just ironic for the dudes who match my description (I guarantee you are plentiful on here) to be bold enough to characterize NBA players as mentally weak and bitches without looking in the mirror.  You wouldn't insult a cashier while waiting for the food you paid for but society has decided it's acceptable in the realm of pro sports- and that's okay as there are much objectively worse things in this world deserving of outrage. But if fans are going to provoke players it's fair game for the players to exercise their authority.	1

Cuomo is still against shutting down business. They deem it okay for me to goto work in a building with 500 plus people.

Also all state workers are allowed to work from home but his office said that temps must stay in state offices if they want to get paid. Again I know someone who started working from home like they were told but later in the day they were forced to come back in. He really isn‚Äôt taking it seriously. I called the health services number that the state keeps telling people to call and they said they can‚Äôt force anyone to follow the guide lines of the state of emergency and it‚Äôs just a suggestion.	0

Doubt you will look into this, you'll probably just keep your head in the sand. 2009, 4g roll out. Swine Flu outbreak. 3g rolled out in 2001 - SARS outbreak 2002. Radio towers massively rolled out. Radio towers massively rolled out in 1910 - Spanish Flu outbreak in 1912.   5G rolled out....first in Wuhan China. 2nd in Spain. Third in Italy. Then the US (major port cities..NY, LA, Seattle).   Do you see a pattern? It may be nothing, but it is absolutely a pattern worth looking at.  The WHO seems radio frequency radiation as carcinogenic.  5G is used in WEAPON SYSTEMS for crowd control. 5G¬†Network Uses Same EMF Waves As Pentagon¬†Crowd Control¬†System. ... Among the many potential problems with exposure to¬†5G¬†radio waves are issues with the skin, which is interesting when you consider that this¬†technology¬†is already being used in the military for¬†crowd control¬†purposes.

I actually did answer his question just in another comment chain right below it. And just for the record you shouldn't brush off what are very clear signs of mental unease in your comments.  A living wage is one in which a person working 40 hours a week can afford all the necessities (shelter, clothing, a phone, health care, etc.) as well as have enough left over at the end of the month for an emergency fund (so that you can actually take a breath that isn't tainted by the pressure of wondering what happens if you miss just one paycheck and maybe not be terrified about your financial situation every waking second).   THAT is a living wage. It will be different depending on the state and even city, and not everyone will be diligent about saving, but what I outlined isn't outrageous or impossible.	0

I don't understand how this would work for seniors who have enough units/credits to graduate. So, lets say the NCAA gave athletes 1 more year, why would you return to school a 5th year and pay 25-50k (if you don't have a scholarship) to play one more season. Specially if you have a low probability of getting drafted, even with one more year under your belt.	0

I think it's just a testament to how out of control it is.   Obviously what everyone wants to happen is they take every precaution they can and the season starts back up again. And another option (that nobody wants) is that the season just ends entirely. But what really really \*cannot\* happen is that they try to restart, they set a date, they even play a couple games... and then somebody gets it and they have to shut down again. That just cannot happen. And the fact that it's already so out of control and we have no real clue when it's going to be in control I think makes people more and more think they'll have to shut things down.	0

Yeah but Kawhi just being there off the ball is such an offensive threat that people can finally recognize why players like him, Durant, Kobe and Jordan are so good, without them you can still have a full offense that will run well. If Harden or LeBron had a bad 4th quarter then the entire team would have done bad because they are the entire offense, they have the ball in their hand all the time and add less off the ball (LeBron because he can‚Äôt shoot as well and Harden for some reason chooses not to). Kawhi literally only took 14 shots in 4 fourth quarters COMBINED like you said which is absolutely nothing- even if he missed all those shots they barely hurt the offense because even though he missed most of his shots he barely took any. At least when he‚Äôs not shooting the ball, his all star point guard can facilitate and the entire team at least has the chance to ball without him. Imagine a pass first point guard like Lowry playing with LeBron lol he would not have the series he had because he simply wouldn‚Äôt get the touches and wouldn‚Äôt have the same options when he has the ball in his hand. If Kawhi had that same percentage on more shots then it would be a different story and if they lost. Not to mention when he actually does get the ball, the other team doubled him way more than they do LeBron (but not as much as Harden) so even if he‚Äôs not getting the points and assists, he‚Äôs changing the shape of the defense in a way that helps him team tremendously. I know everyone won‚Äôt share the same opinions but I think it‚Äôs a testament to Kawhis greatness that he can take his foot off the brakes and still see his team do well only because I rarely ever see that from high usage guards like LeBron and Harden.   I‚Äôm only talking about LeBron and Harden because you mentioned them not because I hate them but you understand my point.  TL;DR he‚Äôs not criticized because Kawhi helps his team win even when he‚Äôs not putting up the stats.	0

Dude, if you think players normally equal their stats from regular season to finals you know jack shit about basketball. The more you talk, the more apparent this becomes. He averaged 1 more turnover than he normally did. I can't believe this is your basis and you genuinely believe this is worthy of discussion.   You wonder why Curry gets a pass for 2016 and LeBron doesn't for 2011? It's because they aren't even close to comparable. And me continuing to indulge this argument is beyond a waste of time. Hope you learn how basketball works some day.	0

Its funny I said something similar about him maximizing his full potential with a great culture, surrounding cast, and winning . Hearing that he's having more fun and now Draymond coming out saying they're trying to help him is a good sign that he's in a great situation for him to live up to his full potential. Maybe about a week back I talked about this on my [podcast](https://www.buzzsprout.com/794936/2699953)  and I think Wiggins will be a great fit with the Warriors once Steph and Klay come back. He's not going to get doubled teamed with those great shooters on the floor with him and he's a proven scorer like Draymond said. I like the move alot for the Warriors	1

First of all, I was just pointing out that the guy I responded to is simply spreading misinformation that quarantine will result in this pandemic passing over faster.

The real goal is to find the perfect point where the total deaths of the impact of corona and a decline in the economy is at its lowest.	0

If I had to guess it‚Äôs because Hockey cares even more about masculinity than basketball does. The culture is all about being tough and masculine, not letting an injury keep you out of the game, dudes are literally allowed to fight each other, etc.   I also read an article where they were saying that hockey is more of a team first game that has less focus on individualism and that players would feel like they‚Äôre disrupting the team and causing a distraction by airing out their personal lives. I can see this as there are far fewer personalities in the NHL than there are in the NBA or even the NFL.	1

1. The Warrior were better the season before Durant than they were with Durant.  2. Curry is more unguardable than Durant (if it were the other way around, Durant would be the one with 2 MVPs) 3. Steph was dropping 30 a game in 34 minutes; KD needed 38+ 4. Steph let KD have more shots because he is a team player with no ego and knew KD's fragile ego needed to feel like he was the man.   I mean, when KD won the Finals MVP, all he could do was go off about how hard it is to set yourself apart from other players on a great team rather than give his teammates credit for opening things up for him.   I feel like Richard Jefferson has some blind spot here, because he is normally a smart dude, but this comment just seems to be way out there.	0

Neither of you all know very much I‚Äôm willing to bet and with all due respect I‚Äôve read no leagues across the globe in sports from soccer to American football to the nba speaking on no fans until a vaccine. Please stop the pessimistic views and let researchers find and develop treatments. And please before any predictions let‚Äôs see if treatments improve enough where hospitals can cope with the virus before going into emergency mode. This is much about treatments and research seen? While working on vaccines you understand.   Everyone needs to stop predicting the fall and definitely 2021 while we are in the spring of 2020. The way this thing impacted society so quickly is the same way things may change for the better. Until then please shut the fuck up with negative predictability shit you all have prolly done very little research on.	0

"> You dont get to decide what someones intent is   Intent doesn't particularly matter in the context of this discussion. I could mistakenly believe that ""faggot"" was a nice term and go around calling my gay friends giant faggots and still be a dumb asshole. Language is collectively determined. The world homo is generally offensive to gay people. If you don't want to be rude to gay people, don't say it. End of discussion.    You can be edgy or offensive for laughs if you want. I certainly am, though not too often regarding homosexuality. But don't throw a fit when someone comes along and points out that it's kind of shitty (even if they can't articulate exactly why all that well).  *edit* I should add, I've known quite a few gay people throughout my life, some of them very close friends, and few of them would be particularly hurt or outraged by hearing ""no homo."" Most likely they would roll their eyes or laugh, depending on the context and who is saying it. They have some of the thickest skin of anyone I've met (not surprising, really). That doesn't mean that if they heard someone who wasn't a friend make this and similar jokes loudly and obnoxiously, they wouldn't step up and tell them to knock it the fuck off as a matter of principle."	1

this loss is on lebron, holy fuck what an embarassment	1
because he gets a lot of uncontested team rebounds where either  someone (Lopez) boxing out is doing all the work or the other team is already running back to set their d.  &#x200B;  if he wasn't so good at bringing the ball up the floor, that wouldn't be the case so take that how you want. but of the top rebounders, i believe he has the lowest % of contested+offensive rebounds which is what great rebounders are usually remembered for.	1
KAT actually sucks! He doesn't have a defensive bone in his body	1

Just like the NBA wanted from the start. They want the season to start later cuz they are sick and tired of getting killed in ratings Becuz of the NFL. This whole thing is scripted, the League must of knew this was coming well before the fans did. It is no coincidence that the media says this and just a week or two later, the season gets suspended	0
Any time a player scores a high volume of points, there are going to be plenty of fouls. If you go back to Wilt Chamberlain's 100 point night, he got 32 foul shots and made 28 (really good, especially for a person that was around 50% from the charity stripe).   But it is also said that Wilt's teammates kept fouling the other team, so they could get the ball back and allow Wilt to get to 100. I think if you are going to put an asterisk on Devin's 70 point night based on your argument, then there should be an asterisk on Wilt's 100 point performance.	0

#GREATEST PLAYER OF ALL TIME*	1
In the 60s there were 8 teams so Wilt and Russel had to go up against a Hall of Famer almost every night. Many of the guys playing back then were legends, and its mighty disrespectful to say they weren't. Also I don't care what era youre in, Bill Russell has a ring for every single finger, and his dick for christs sake! Wilt averaged 50 for an entire season. Wilt averaged 39 ppg thru 7 seasons. Thats fucking batshit. Russell is 21-0 in elimination games. Without him, on two seperate occasions his teams went on losing streaks when he was injured, so you cant say he just had a good team. Listen, I dont mean to insult you, but perhaps you should go watch some of their actual games before spouting out nonsense youve been hearing in the echo chamber that we call reddit.   Sorry if i got a little carried away. Imo russell and wilt are at least top 5 all time.	0

I am saying of the **top rebounders in the NBA** and you're comparing Giannis' rebounding statistics to Lebron, Harden, and Westbrook?  &#x200B;  Top 5 Rebounders:  &#x200B;  Drummond @ 15. 8 REB  Gobert @ 14.6 REB  Whiteside @ 14 REB  Capela @ 13.8 REB  Giannis @ 13.4 REB  [https://stats.nba.com/players/rebounding/?sort=REB&dir=1](https://stats.nba.com/players/rebounding/?sort=REB&dir=1)  &#x200B;  Top 5 Contested Rebounders:  &#x200B;  Drummond @ 7.3 C. REB  Whiteside @ 6.8 C. REB  Capela @ 6.6 C. REB  Gobert @ 5.3 C. REB  Wendell Carter Jr. @ 5.3 C. REB  **Giannis is #16 at 4.4 C.

Of the top 5 rebounders, Giannis is by far the lowest in both the contested and offensive rebounding categories. Giannis is #5 in total rebounds, #16 at contested rebounds, and #29 at offensive rebounds. Compare that to Drummond who is #1 in all 3 categories, Capela who is #4 total rebounds, #3 contested, and #2 offensive, etc.	1

When I was 13, I knew this girl who was my age. Looking back now, I realize this girl was a little hoe. Hell, this girl asked me(we were both 13), if I ever got a BJ. She told me she liked me, a few days later, she tells another boy she likes him. Fast foward a few months, this girl gets pregnant by a 20 year old. Looking back now, I dont blame the 20 year old because I know he didnt rape her. She was a crazy little slut. I blame the little hoe and the little hoes mother.  Everyone always gets so outraged but truth is, you dont know the facts. You don't know if this girl lied about her age and said she was 16 or 17. You can't say Karl raped her because you werent there, and he was never even charged with rape.   He was 20 years old at the time. its a 7 year difference...   The other day on /r/relationship_advice I saw some early 20s girl post something about marrying and having a kid with a like a 40 year old. It was like a 19 year difference and no one bats an eye.	0

That playoff run was everything. Not only did Dirk play out of his mind all playoffs, but he got revenge against the same team that broke his heart 5 years earlier in the finals and he did it by spearheading one of the greatest comebacks ever in game 2. The general consensus among nba fans was that Dirk would retire without a ring, that he was soft. It was incredible seeing him finally come through and putting all that to bed. The sad thing is he should have been in the mix more afterwards. If Cuban doesn‚Äôt split up that team the following season I think they‚Äôre repeating or at least competing. One of the biggest misconceptions about the 2011 Mavs was that it was some sort of fluke. That‚Äôs false, that team was really really good especially defensively and Tyson Chandler was the heart and soul of that defence and the perfect big to play next to Dirk. I don‚Äôt understand the decision to let him go.	0

What you guys don't understand is how broke Tillman Fertitta is right now.  Calling him a billionaire is misleading because he's as liquid as tile.  In fact, he's positioned about as poorly as you could be.  All of his primary revenue streams are literally shut down: restaurant, casino, hospitality, basketball.  He's highly leveraged.  He took out high interest loans against his hospitality businesses so he could buy the Rockets.  Les Alexander (former Rockets owner) also personally loaned him $175m to complete the Rockets sale.  And don't forget that he lost a huge Chinese revenue stream right before the season started.  Also, just to add insult to injury, the Thunder were actually better than the Rockets after the Russell Westbrook trade which is a reminder that the Rockets are on the books for mega max deals to Westbrook and Harden.  Tillman strikes me as the kind of guy to not pay in a circumstance like this anyway (if you've seen a few episodes of Billion Dollar Buyer, you get a feel for him) but he probably doesn't have the money to cough up as is.  Think about it - 1) if he's taking out high interest bonds on his primary companies that means his credit wasn't that good to begin with and he was illiquid and 2) he took out a $175m personal loan to complete the sale which means he didn't have that cash lying around.  Tilman is highly leveraged, all of his primary revenue streams have gone to 0 and will stay there for the next 2-3 months, all of his companies have taken a huge haircut in valuation (meaning he sells any right now and probably loses 20% off the top) and he has no cash on hand.  This man is positioned incredibly badly.  Like you'd almost have to try to be in a worse position.	0

Corona Virus is a group of diseases (well viruses to be exact) that only poses threat to people that have weakened immune systems, have another major disease meaning babies, very sick people, and old people with deteriorated overall health.  No NBA player (assuming all of them without any major diseases) is in danger of ever getting fully sick from the Corona virus. They might get affected and be a carrier, but none of them are at risk of dying (since that's what most people are concerned about).  And to the people thinking guys like Embiid are at a higher risk - Physically injured a lot =/= prone to diseases. Guys who eat ass or get dirty with the strippers are at more risk than the guys who get muscle tears or knee problems.	1

"> just because someone somewhere has it worse it does not mean that anyone‚Äôs struggle isn‚Äôt valid or real.  Want to stick up for Mr. Billionaire who's ""struggling"" because they only have the 10th biggest yacht in the world?  Or Mr. Former Bank CEO who's ""struggling"" because they aren't the CEO anymore and have only a $100 million severance package to live on?  Or Mr. Rapist who's ""struggling"" because they're on 10 years probation for raping a 14 year old girl, despite serving no jail time?  > Everything is relative my guy  Exactly.  To me, the ""struggles"" I listed as well as the ""struggles"" of those who earn 600K+ but live paycheck to paycheck are ridiculous and trivial, just like any struggles I have had in my life pale in comparison to those of a homeless guy or a chronically ill person.  Everyone has their own perspective on how big a struggle is based on their own experiences.  I think it's absolutely justified for someone to dismiss the struggles of others or lack sympathy when they've faced far greater challenges."	0

Advanced stats (Especially Metrics based on PBP data like PIPM/Raptor/RAPM) don‚Äôt entirely Measure True Impact or True creation . They have collinearity issues, they Don‚Äôt filter for schemes, roster construction & fit.   What Creation and/or impact metrics tells us is  actually ‚ÄúPhiladelphia is 3 points per 48 minutes better than the opposing lineups in stints that included Tobias Harris.‚Äù Unfortunately, we do not have an unlimited parentheses unfortunately, we do not have an unlimited amount of Trials to test out every possible lineup featuring Harris.This means that we cannot know how much of the three point differential is attributable to Harris. We also will not be able to tell us how those lineups would perform without harass against the same opponent lineups.  What we can do is use a prior to represent what we believe a player‚Äôs impact to have been with other lineups in other seasons. This allows us to correct outliers among low minute players, but does not tell us any more about what has happened in the season under consideration   Also, Curry‚Äôs creation for me is in line with Kawhi/KD but below Harden/ LeBron.    He‚Äôs not really a a great passer imo. A guy like Durant creates Far better off the dribble. On any randomized Possession, KD will take his man off the dribble & find the open man far better than Curry will. with Curry the ball ends up in draymond‚Äôs hands a lot once he Can‚Äôt establish separation on his defender. He doesn‚Äôt have great vision where he's making elite creation plays (passes) where there aren't seemingly points. He's 2nd or 3rd on the team in assists every year despite being 1st in USG% & touches (yes, even more than KD  Curry also plays with Statistically the best passing team in NBA history. When Warriors run 2 or 3 screens for him & he gets trapped, Warriors zip it around the court with incredible accuracy and Vision. Guys like Livingston, Iggy, Dray are very High IQ, they are also able to find Steph offball with ease.  If Steph played on a standard NBA team, with average passers, Low Iq players, An average coach, decent defensive talent, the offense would drop off heavily.  I think majority of NBA fans Believe Durant to be better because It‚Äôs incredibly easy to build a contender around him. Just surround him with A lowry/Rubio type, and A few rebounders & you‚Äôre in contention.   He masks a lot of weaknesses  Bc he‚Äôs so versatile on both sides of the ball, he plays 4 positions on offense and 3-4 on defense.  With Steph, You need much more. An elaborate screening scheme (warriors run most of off ball screens per game), Very good coaching & play calling, A Playmaking 4 that‚Äôs operated in space (Draymond) & You always have to have Elite POA defenders.   There‚Äôs just very little repeatability with Steph on a randomized set of teammates than W/ a KD or LeBron for example. I roll with Durant for these reasons but I‚Äôm not totally Against Curry, especially if you have An insane foundation already. I didn‚Äôt mean to sound condescending if I come off that way.	0

"There is some truth to this. If only Carmelo Anthony turned down his role in Ninja Turtles: Out Of The Shadows cameo I think the Knicks would have won it all that year. I remember sitting in the movie theater watching this movie and Carmelo pops on screen. My Uncle, spilled his popcorn in a fit of rage, squeezed my testicles and said ""Welp, no point in watching the Knicks this year"" before he got up and left. I stayed and finished the movie because of Megan Fox."	1

Theres so many worse franchises. The pistons have history and have won a championship in the new millennium. Det def took some bit hits as a city in the last 20 years but detroit is not close to the worst franchise in the nba. Yea i live in michigan haha so take my whining with a grain of salt.	0

AI averaged 36 PPG in the finals against a Lakers team that swept everyone in the West. Iverson was supposed to get swept too but he made a statement in game 1 by carrying the 76ers top a win with 50 points. Curry only averaged 30 PPG last finals because pf his 47 point outlier, and he only got 47 points because Raptors were up 20 points the whole game so the defense was more relaxed. Every other finals he averaged 21-26 PPG on like 40% FG, there's a reason why he never won Finals MVP. Curry never scored when it mattered, he basically got trash points. Even the last finals when he averaged 30 PPG, Klay was the MVP as he was scoring with efficiency and scored to keep the game close. Curry was shooting them out of the games and then scored when GS was already up, thanks to Klay. Curry had that great 47 point game, but like I said, as great as that performance was, they were never a threat to get the game close so they were basically empty stats. Curry also has other players to take the pressure off of scoring from him and he still is inefficient and can't score when he's called to do it. You're trying to say Iverson never played the level of performance that Steph did in the finals? You're correct, because he was at a different level than Steph. Iverson was the only option and still scored on the Lakers, and that's with Shaq protecting the paint. You're so retarded it's hilarious. Bullshit nostalgia? Nah use your eyes and watch the game. Call a spade a spade when you see it, and the spade is that Curry can't score at will, Iverson can. That's why AI averaged 36 PPG in the finals, more than what Curry has averaged in FIVE finals appearances. That's why AI averaged 28-34 PPG in the regular season even though he was the only option to score and make plays during his prime. In terms of scoring, AI is better than Curry.	0

I think the only concern should be where it could effect their natural development. From what Id gathered previously (and just google) the majority of pre-pubescent boys who are diagnosed with gender dysphoria lose those feelings through adolescence. Now obviously there's heavy cultural influences and other caveats at play, but theres reason to be skeptical of making permanent decisions too early.   Treat em as they want to be treated though.	1

The part where you wrote 'his child isn't transitioning' does make it clear, though. Using different pronouns and a different name is absolutely one part of transitioning (though it doesn't necessarily *have* to be), and transitioning does not imply only changes that involve medical or surgical procedures. She's changed her preferred name and asked that she/her be used for her pronouns.  I get where the other reply is coming from, it's not that you're being particularly offensive here but cis people speaking up about what is/isn't appropriate/complicated/acceptable for trans people can be a real sore spot when the opinions of actual trans people are actively being disregarded.	1

Dwight was amazing OFF the ball or on the pick and roll. But he had no really offensive moves with the ball in hand.   His foot work was mediocre at best, and his only move was this shoulder drop-then-spear that should been called for an offensive foul more often than it was.   We actually saw that in the NBA finals when Gasol was taking the bump/charge on that move and the officials actually started calling it after Phil Jackson made a point of mentioning in a post-game interview (taking the fine for criticizing the officials).   The issue was that Dwight simply wasn't the kind of guy who had the offensive tools to average 25+ a game, but he wanted to be in the conversation with Shaq, Hakeem, and Wilt, not Mourning and Mutumbo. So he wanted more touches, and more time in the post, and SVG woulldn't give it to him (and for good reason).   Which soured his relationship with Orlando.   Then Dwight didn't want to run the pick-and-roll in LA and got stuck with an offensive coach who didn't care about D.   But even on defense, there were times when Dwight would do that volleyball spike. I felt like it was just because it looked good. He could have tipped those down and kept position instead of giving the ball back to the other team out of bounds.   He was great to watch, but those highlights are misleading. They show his athleticism at its best.	0

">so to step in here as someone who has been following this quite closely and is at least half-assed capable in this field:  Half-assed appeal to authority? How bout dox yourself with your credentials? No? So you're full of it? Thanks for confirming! ""Appeal to authority"" is a classic conservative attempt at argument, it's also one of the most easily spotted and absolutely stupid, simply braindead, fallacies in a logic 101 class. It's stuff that people who have actually ever read a book laugh at you gormless dorks for. Don't do it. Let this be your ""getting off easy"" warning, you're gonna get made fun of more harshly in the future if you don't at least get some basic brains in there. Start by easing off r/conservative, right wing internet spaces (rcon, the\_donald, 4chan) are well-known as some of the stupidest, most brain-rotting communities you can engage with.

Every QB in the league plays with the air pressure in the footballs because the league let teams supply their own. Brady‚Äôs were probably right at the lower boundary at the start of the game but the cold temps dropped the pressure below the limit. A bunch of educators have used this to teach the relevant chemistry/physics. Check out the last couple pages [here](http://chemistrye.weebly.com/uploads/3/7/7/0/37707825/gas_laws_case_study.pdf).  The fact that the league lets each team supply its own balls for the game, never recorded pressures prior to the game, and had never checked them during the game prior to that particular game, should probably tell you how much the league cared about the air pressure before this.    A ball that is fully inflated in the locker room (to the maximum PSI of 13.5) would still be under the minimum legal pressure if the game was played at a temp roughly 20 degrees colder than the room they were stored in before the initial measurement. Considering the sport is played in the fall and winter, that‚Äôs probably a large chunk of games.   That said, even if they were under inflating the balls, there‚Äôs zero evidence this actually means anything to the ability to throw or catch it. No one has actually tested in any meaningful way the effect of the relative inflation level of a football on how easy it is to throw or catch. The NFL‚Äôs rules appear to be based solely on the manufacturer‚Äôs recommendations.   What the falcons were doing almost certainly had more of an impact on the results of games. There wasn‚Äôt a 35 million dollar fishing expedition in to that one, tho, or a couple hundred pages of reports that scientists mostly scoffed at.	0

"i'm certain the most important thing every season for utah fans is making sure rudy gobert makes the all-star team. i don't understand it because nearly every single time ""the best defender in the nba"" plays the rockets he gets run off the floor. it's quite embarrassing to be honest. you can't go from getting embarrassed by capela to getting embarrassed by covington.   but i truly do feel bad for utah fans. they know for a fact that no matter who they add to their team they'll never be able to beat james harden or the rockets when it matters. adding westbrook to this team must sting even more seeing how utah feels about him.  it must be such a helpless feeling hating two players as much as utah does and knowing that in spite of their burning hatred towards harden and russ they'll never be able to beat the rockets.  sure, people will bring up the rockets vs the warriors and that's fair. i admit. but that doesn't change that everything i just said is true.   here's to hoping mitchell/gobert isn't just another stockton/malone jazz fans!"	1

Off the backboard between the legs is objectively better than any dunk in the 88 contest.   Same with a 5‚Äô8 player jumping over a 7 footer.   Same with a behind the back dunk.   I can keep going, but the dunks in 88 are ass compared to what the players attempted over the past decade. Not every dunk attempt is a gimmick, and I agree, gimmick dunks are ass. But you‚Äôre a dumbass if you think the dunks in 88 are better than what we‚Äôve seen in the past decade. Most of the absolute greatest dunk contest dunks have been in the 00‚Äôs and 10‚Äôs not the 80‚Äôs.	1

The test shit is so overblown. Most people don't need a test. The treatment is the same as a common flu. Rest + fluids, tylenol/NSAIDs for fever and aches, go to hospital if you have breathing issues or high/prolonged fever. Isolate yourself from others.  Getting a test does nothing for you beyond giving you something to post on twitter about. If you're sick stay home even if its not COVID-19. Testing at this point is only really useful on non-symptomatic people who won't know to quarantine otherwise. But, we can't test hundreds of millions of people every week so that's not ever going to be an option. Everyone should chill on the testing nonsense and just assume they have it if they get sick.	0

"In retrospect, when I look back I realize my parents raised me very well. However, when I was a kid, I thought the opposite. My parents gave me so much advice that I started tuning it out. I 100% would've listen to a celebrity I looked up to's social media post more than my parents. Kids on the cusp of puberty and teenagers are simply hardwired to be rebellious, they listen to people who they think are ""cool"" instead of their parents. There are literally countless books, movies, and real anecdotes about kids and teenagers refusing to listen to their parents, about following what the ""cool"" people do, it's just what happens.  You clearly do not have any children over the age of 10 if you think kids not listening to their parents are a result of them not being raised properly. Don't fucking act like you know how to raise a child ""correctly"" when you've never raised one yourself, you pompous ass.

I think you‚Äôre underestimating how bad things really were at the time for them to do that and with the new era of social media, sports, Netflix and drugs being easy for people to get if they want people are always able to distract from wider issues that don‚Äôt directly affect them. Back then they were literally starving to death it would take something like that for a revolution to happen it would have to be a significant amount of the population literally on the brink of dying before this would happen.   There‚Äôs also the fact that despite its glorification the French Revolution didn‚Äôt really help things that much while they had some great ideas they also decided to execute anyone who disagreed with them or if they were just religious and it lead to lots of people just trying to gain more power for themselves. It wasn‚Äôt French Revolution happened and then the monarchy never came back and everything was good there were like 4 French Revolutions and lots of government changes and deaths.	0

Yes? Youre not thinking clearly if you think otherwise.  Exposing more people to corona means that they get it and it goes away after some time and develop immunity/resistance to it, or in some cases they die.

This isnt true at all. On any level.  Lin wasn't traded. He got injured that year. He was a restricted RFA and the Rockets offered such a huge contract that the Knicks didn't want to match. At the time of his signing, the third year was $15 million. That was more than all but like the top 20 players in the league was making. Lebron and Chris Paul were making $16 million that year. Lin wasn't that good and there were concerns he wasn't going to be the same when he recovered.   As for the Melo vs Lin thing... The media completely manufactured it as far as anyone call tell.

**How do I work?** First I read as many new comments as I can and turn each one into a list of noun phrases (things like 'raindrop' or 'brown paper package'). Next I pluralize them and run them through an algorithm to determine the number of syllables each noun phrase contains.

Yes.  I am the moron.  Not the one making subjective arguments on something people agree shouldn't be subjective.  And making more of an emphasis on one thing over another because that's your PERSONAL OPINION  Damn though.  I guess Shaq's Magic beating Jordan in a playoff series doesn't count because MJ wasn't back into playing shape.  I guess the Cavs won that following year because Draymond lost his mind.  I guess the Raptors should have an asterisk because KD was injured and Klay went down in a key last stretch.   I guess the year the Nash Suns got suspended for a make or break game shoulda just cancelled the season.  And really, I guess you are a diehard Lebron/Cavs fan or something.  But also just a fucking moron.   Injuries (something that happen every year and isn't controlled by anyone) is the thing you go for.  Not the ref job for Wade's Heat in '06.    Ahh okay.  Feels good refuting an actual moron calling other people morons because your opinion isn't agreed upon in a matter that shouldn't have opinions.  Enough time though.  Blocked.  GL	0

I have played against a few actually. In high school, I played at a prep school in New England, a lot of the best players from the East Coast end up at one of these schools. I played against Donovan Mitchell and Devonte Graham - they were actually on the same team. Their team was basically twelve deep with D1 talent so those two actually did not have to do much, and we still got completely smoked (our team was acutally really good itself). Warm up lines were very entertaining to watch. They had such high, effortless, speed. And their fakes and dribble moves were just so convincing. I was a rotation player, and spent some time guarding both of them, and basically felt like my shoes were nailed to the floor. They weren't though, I just suck.  Some lesser known players I played against during the same time period are Noah Vonleh, Wayne Selden, Terance Mann, Bruce Brown, and plenty more high major guys who are probably drifting around the G-League and European leagues. I could go on and on about these guys. I think Wayne Selden caught a 360 alley oop in game, and also hit eight 3s. Noah Vonley was basically a 6'10 point guard, who also just made every shot.  If you did not know, ESPN ranks the top 100 high school basketball recruits. At the time I actually had a player ranked in the top 30 on my team. So I played against him basically everyday for two years. He was a super bouncy PF. I think he plays in Europe now after having a slightly disappointing college career at a high major program. In pick up games within our team, it was fairly common for him to 360 windmill on a breakaway. He definitely had serious aspirations of making the NBA - at the time me and my teammates thought he could go one and done. In college he was mostly a rebounder and all around athlete, but in high he could basically do whatever he wanted, even against the best competition in the country. In practice I honestly think he dunked on me 30 - 40 times; a few of which definitely could have made ESPN if someone was filming; I think i am in the clear though	0

There's absolutely no way in hell Gobert should make the All-Star game this year.  There's no way he should be picked ahead of guys like Dame, Mitchell, Jokic, Westbrook, CP3, Booker and Ingram, that's not even mentioning guys that will probably make it, but played less games like PG and KAT.  Rudy is more in the bordeline All-Star category with guys like D-Lo, DeRozan and Aldridge this year.	1
Bro. No. Just stop. *some* players do better in the playoffs *sometimes.* overwhelmingly every player averages less in the playoffs than they do in the regular season for a multitude of fairly obvious reasons that have clearly flown over your head.

Here is a question for you? Have you followed what any other countries are doing?  Because Canada is offering people $2000 a month, plus Canadians have health care and aren‚Äôt reliant on insurance.  Canada also has it so you can‚Äôt travel across provinces too, and stay at home orders in every location.   The growth of covid in the states is increasing faster than any other country and has been for about 2 weeks. It isn‚Äôt going to slow down either.  It is hilarious how ignorant you are if you think that the trump administration has been doing a good job preparing for this. You need to compare your country vs other countries, not what Trump has done vs other presidents who have never faced an epidemic. I‚Äôm glad you enjoy my username, it represents people like you!	0

MLB learned its lesson after the McCourt saga, where it allowed him to buy the Dodgers when he didnt actually have many (if any) liquid funds. Instead, it allowed him to use real estate he owned, including the parking lot next to Dodgers Stadium, as collateral for financing. Of course, eventually he couldn't meet the payroll. Rules were changed so new owners had to have certain liquidity to be able to purchase a team. The NBA should have never allowed someone who theoretically was asset rich, but cash poor, to buy a team, and utilize as much debt on his future personal finances. You can use debt to buy a team, but you need that person can actually provide liquid funding if need be. And that's before you dig further into Fertitta/his family's finances. Then you learn they truly don't have any cash on hand	0

Jackson would get fired in less than 2 seasons. Legendary coaches ride the backs of their Great players. Lebron wouldn't give jackson a chance to implement any type of system. Coaching doesn't get brought up because lebron had more than several chances to play for great coaches and he chose henchmen, that wouldn't ruffle his LeFeathers too much.

"I'm working on a project right now in Hollywood with a pretty urgent deadline, and the whole group I'm with is just utterly stunned, to the point that all work has just stopped, and nothing we cared about deeply just hours ago even matters.  This is a heart-stoppingly sad.  It really reminds you that anything can happen to anyone without warning.  I've watched the Lakers my whole life, and now it just feels like watching them going forward will always be tinged with sadness.  I just can't believe that Kobe is dead.  Like any fan, I shit-talked our star player, particularly during his ""farewell tour"" last season (typing 'farewell tour' just officially made me start crying).  The last thing I ever said about him on the Internet was very unkind, even if based in facts.  I regret being so cruel now.  I'm just losing it from emotions.  In a way, this is like living through Magic's announcement of HIV again, back when that was considered a death sentence.  I remember where I was (college class), who I was with, and the utter shock and sadness of everyone around me.  I swore to appreciate life more back then, and now I'm examining once again wether I've lived up to that oath of appreciating my life.  Just wow, and devastated.  Appreciate life, folks, appreciate life.  Rest in Peace, Kobe."	1

>CDC estimates 80% of the country gets this thing before it's over. That's 256 million people. 2% of that is over 5 million  This is a huge distortion. The range I've read is from 40% to 70%, and the vast majority of cases are mild (80%).  You do a huge disservice by automatically projecting the worst case scenario.  If Italy is the worse case, the avg age of those that died is in the 80s.   People *need* to go back to work. Millions live paycheck to paycheck - they cannot just not work. Unrest can lead to looting and violence, which can also overload the system.  Again, you have very little life experience to understand the downstream effects. Your view is myopic - you only understand the hysteria in front of you, and you immediately jump to the worst case scenario *as your base case*. A complete fallacy.	1

"Why would the ruling class of bankers and warmongers willfully put a cap on their own wealth? Why would the ruling class of billionaires willfully split up big business against their interests? Capitalism is when the ruling class of wealthy ""capitalists"" own private property and use their government to protect their interests. Capitalism is when the government steals workers' taxes to bailout Wall Street. That is unconditionally not socialism.   So you're actually advocating that workers become the ruling class, because there is no other way to exert such a cap on wealth, which means you're actually arguing for socialism, which means we need to forcefully seize land and factories and distribution networks while abolishing IP. It's good to feel this way but now it's time to stop expecting capitalism to just be better and start to study Marx and working class history"	0

I think there's good reason to support him and back our president. The NBA could greatly benefit from it and I won't entertain those comparisons, since those two aren't even in the same realm as DT.  From a pure # of votes standpoint sure, he lost but it's not a fair argument when you add in overpopulated urban markets into the equation as those are breeding grounds for Democrats.  2020 might be different, he's very likely to win the popular vote	0
It wasn't a goaltend. The defender didn't alter the flightpath of the ball, despite what your eyes may report. The camera angle was deceptive.	1
"Same here.  I was 10 when he retired.  I've been looking at YouTube videos about him lately.  Aside from the lethal ability and killer instinct, his passing is absolutely fucking stupid.  He'd have the defense chasing shadows, he could fake me right out of my chair.  [Here's 60 seconds of the most retarded fakes I've ever seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuWuTbxgLTI).  The behind the head ones are the best, also when he would put the ball behind his defender's head, who would turn around to chase it, then Bird pulls it back and drops a 3 on him lol  A great quote I heard from Pat Riley was, ""if I had to pick someone to make a shot to save a game, I'd want Michael Jordan.  If I had to pick someone to make a shot to save my life, I'd want Larry Bird"""	1
I can't speak for everyone but honestly the more people overplay the situation the more inclined I am to believe it's blown out of proportion. That's not to say it's not serious, just not as serious as everyone is blowing it up to be.	1

"Assume by some natural process you detweilerTeej started turning into the opposite gender.  If you're a guy and you start growing breasts and losing muscle you will likely hate it, opposite is true for a girl who's starts growing larger and more hairy with a deeper voice.  You would likely feel like you are in the wrong body.   Its not so much physical ""damage"", its physiological. I'm not very invested in trans issues but at least as far as trans people *feel* that's the comparison.    Blockers basically buy time to make sure a kid really has gender dysphoria, and gets them closer to mental maturity so they can be more equipped to decide.  Downsides are not really known but at least from the available stats seem to strongly outweigh the psychological damage of making/letting someone go through puberty as the ""wrong"" gender."	1

"I dont think anyone who has the choice between a sink w/ soap and hand sanitizer is arguing hand sanitizer does it better. what IS being argued is when sink w/ soap isnt nearby, sanitizer IS a safe and convenient option to use when 60% alc or more. running down halls or to another building or wherever its obviously not convenient is not good advice when you have a reliable method in hand sanitizer.  shitposting up and down saying ""wash your hands!!!!!"" in response to saying hand sanitizer works on a post about hand sanitizer not working is stupid. if its convenient and right there, wash your hands. If its not convenient and you have hand sanitizer, use a healthy amount and youre fine. if anything opening door handles out of the bathroom that carry germs is far more dangerous to risk than hands free squirts from a bottle that can air dry where you sit. no navigating or grabbing of door handles required at your desk or whatever. neither option is bad, but going out of your way to find a sink w/soap because you refuse hand sanitizer is retarded."	0

I agree.  A 400 DL is chicken shit any HS kid finished with puberty can do within 6 mos of training.   500 is something someone with  average ability can train to.  If he trained for he, he would DL in the 700s at least, but considering he's playing bball, ill say 455 bench, kevin durant benched 315,  mid 600 DL, 500 to 600 sq if it's a full range squat, a lot more in a powerlifting style squat to parallel.   These are conservative.  He could play on an nfl defensive line.  Throw bball player numbers out the window, he isnt built like a basketball player.	0

">That still doesn't make it their responsibility to close our borders and make more virus tests.  The blame for the slow response goes to the White House and only the White House.  I have never given my opinion on the White House's actions but I do not agree with how the president handled the situation.  Like I said, I only wanted to point out that saying journalists need to be spoonfed information is asinine. It's not like they don't know about the seriousness of the situation, they have Chinese correspondents for crying out loud. On top of that their job description is to literally do research and not just trust everything someone tells them.  The assumption that a white house briefing turns ""travel bans are racist"" into journalists delivering a heartfelt message to the american people like you're suggesting in the post I responded to is, in my humble opinion, psychotic."	0

Doubt you will look into this, you'll probably just keep your head in the sand. 2009, 4g roll out. Swine Flu outbreak. 3g rolled out in 2001 - SARS outbreak 2002. Radio towers massively rolled out. Radio towers massively rolled out in 1910 - Spanish Flu outbreak in 1912.   5G rolled out....first in Wuhan China. 2nd in Spain. Third in Italy. Then the US (major port cities..NY, LA, Seattle).   Do you see a pattern? It may be nothing, but it is absolutely a pattern worth looking at.  The WHO seems radio frequency radiation as carcinogenic.  5G is used in WEAPON SYSTEMS for crowd control. 5G¬†Network Uses Same EMF Waves As Pentagon¬†Crowd Control¬†System. ... Among the many potential problems with exposure to¬†5G¬†radio waves are issues with the skin, which is interesting when you consider that this¬†technology¬†is already being used in the military for¬†crowd control¬†purposes.  Head still in the sand?	0
Curry won his Mvps, scoring title and a championship without kd. His numbers dropped when kd came. You can argue that kd killed curry's dominance and didnt help him. Kd was the beneficiary of curry's dominance. Kd never had a signature playoff series till he went to the warriors. Okc called him Mr unreliable because his numbers dropped in the playoffs. In golden state he became an afterthought because teams were worried about allowing curry to get hot.. Klay haas shot 41.9% 3pt for his career. Without curry, that 3pt % drops to 38%. We all saw draymomd's true value this season. Draymond is only a beneficiary of curry. Put draymond on a team with westbrook and im sure he wont even be in the starting line up in 2 yrs.. Curry is a great shooter from 3pt, midrange, finishing around the rim and the best FT shooter in nba history..Curry finishes around the rim more efficiently than kyrie. Kyrie may be flashy but curry is more efficient..He makes his team mates better. Half of the players he took to the finals last year arent even in the nba anymore..  Hope you understand that curry became an all star and all nba player under mark jackson. Before steve kerr became their coach. Draymond wasnt even a starter then. And also he was supposed to be an all star the year before but was snubbed..Even charles barkley cursed the all star voters out in 2013 for snubbing curry.	0

That's not at all what it states, it backs the original commenters point that if Warren was as progessive as she claimed to have been she would have backed a candidate who shared her policies/ not gone back on some of her progessive stances. You refuted that implying she can still be progessive without endorsing Bernie, I explained to you how all of their shared progessive platform wasn't enough for her to endorse him while the other candidates policy is completely opposed to hers, making her not as progessive as she claimed to be, the orginial commenters point that you seemed to disagree with. You can blame Bernie for not running a good campaign but Liz's failure to quit the race before super Tues with no path to the nomination while the centrists all dropped out and endorsed Biden the days prior was a massive and decisive swing in the primary. Was always going to be an uphill battle for Bernie and fine with him not winning, but disappointed in Liz not backing the candidate that ideologically was extremely similar to her	0

Why do you refuse to acknowledge that Brown and Tatum took a step forward this year because Kyrie is gone? It's fairly clear that you refuse to acknowledge any narrative that involves Kyrie taking any blame for the Celtics last season.

One guy made a misguided and poorly judged tweet, about another tweet, related to something happening on the other side of the world.   The other permanently inked his body with the visage of 4 guys who oversaw and pioneered mass genocide, rape, and several other war crimes in the country he grew up in and has lived in aside from his playing career. He also actively supports the political party that aligns with those former leaders.

"We were all mad at the guy that killed Jordan's father. I'd have to google it, to see if that's the real reason he went to baseball. But that's what I've hung onto.   That first half season he came back there was a lot of anxiety to see the ""real"" Jordan. The championships won during that in between time were fake. They weren't earned from Jordan. They were like kids acting up when the substitute came in.  When he finally traded the 45 in. That was for real. However crafted that was, I dunno. But I bought that Hook line and sinker.  With the COVID deal, thinking about watching the finals again. But think I'll start with the Pistons beating the Bulls that year prior. That series, losing to Thomas but knowing it was just fuel to the fire, is the first time I remember watching Jordan. As it is now, I can't even remember all six opponents.

Doubt you will look into this, you'll probably just keep your head in the sand. 2009, 4g roll out. Swine Flu outbreak. 3g rolled out in 2001 - SARS outbreak 2002. Radio towers massively rolled out. Radio towers massively rolled out in 1910 - Spanish Flu outbreak in 1912.   5G rolled out....first in Wuhan China. 2nd in Spain. Third in Italy. Then the US (major port cities..NY, LA, Seattle).   Do you see a pattern? It may be nothing, but it is absolutely a pattern worth looking at.

No.  This is the problem with the media and trying to create mass hysteria by attaching the word 'deadly' to every headline because it's 'technically' correct.  The figures aren't completely settled but the from a few articles, just based off the amount of confirmed cases v. those who have died from it, the mortality rate is estimated to be between 2-4%. Obviously, there are cases that won't be noticed and deaths that will be 'missed' in the count. Those who are dying include the elderly and the immunocompromised.  But even then, to put in perspective, look at the annual influenza virus. I'd say most people consider it kind of a shitty nuisance to get around the holiday times, but the perception of the annual flu isn't marked by media outrage and fear mongering. The mortality rate for those aged 50-64 is about 9%.	1

I don't get why people think guy is some lowkey douche. I remember watching a player tribune video and guy seemed like a very well-spoken and geniune dude. Maybe he has faults and could seem immature but it doesn't seem he is some POS person. It's why I laugh at the arrogant Jimmy Butler fanboys thinking KAT is not some good hearted person. I really feel bad for his loss man.    I'm done with people being entitled in America. It's not just about taking things seriosuly but just understnading the situation. Many people complain about how much these lockdowns are hurting many people and I aree. We can't expect to lockdown America for so long, but we need to get people hve already and can be affected by this and it's not good. It's why I wish people just stopped panicking like the babies in r/coronovirus making everything seemed like the end of the world and people at /unpopularopinion saying this virus is a joke and that everything should cater ot people who won't bve affected and going to malllies and getting dollies for my baby girl is more important. Hey consevrtive go FUCK YOURSELF. I don't care if KAT is a celebrity, his mother fuckin died and seemed like a average American. Fuck America at times. Hope people just take things seriosuly and just look towards getting things done SOON. We could possibly get this under control, we should always have faith. The season can literally restart in 2020.

The United States was ranked the best-prepared country in the world to handle a pandemic in late 2019 by the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security (JHCHS) -- an assessment seemingly at odds with claims by Democrats that the Trump administration left the country vulnerable to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.

If LeBron handpicked his teammates he could have picked a hell of a lot better ones. He could‚Äôve joined much better teams than the lakers.   LeBron doesn‚Äôt have full control over who gets signed. That‚Äôs absurd. He has input sure, but he‚Äôs not hand picking who is signed or who teams draft.   And if my aunt had a dick she would be my uncle. Players make fucking shots. That happens. LeBron scored 16 that quarter btw. Which you ignorant fools like to ignore.   Sure let‚Äôs say the cavs lose in 2016. Give me all of my hypotheticals and LeBron has a hell of a lot more than 3 rings.   Ray Allen is a hypothetical because he didn‚Äôt miss.   I never mentioned 2011 as that is obviously a stain on his legacy.   No one is removing him of blame you numb nuts. We just actually have a brain and use it to provide context.	0

Lebron loses. He whined about being called a bitch and has bitchmade tendencies which you can see in his various flop compilations. Lebron gets destroyed, which is normal life. He's known to get historical beatdowns in the finals and this isn't out of the ordinary. I'd want to make sure a health screen was done first so we don't have to deal with a broken collarbone excuse, broken femur, overactive thyroid or whatever excuse he might come up with and pay his shills to pedal.

"They could have offered him the larger extension this previous offseason. The article is referring to the offseason before that, when Kyrie and the Celtics were in good terms. Since the season happened, the Celtics made absolutely no attempt to re sign hkm despite having the chance to offer him a bigger extension than any other team before free agency began.

That‚Äôs way too low of an estimate. Tyson Fury is shorter than LeBron (Bron is 6‚Äô8.5‚Äù barefoot. Tyson is listed at 6‚Äô9‚Äù but he‚Äôs more like 6‚Äô7‚Äù-6‚Äô‚Äù8 based on pictures.

The answer is no, a 23-yr old, 3rd year Ceballos was not going to tilt the series vs the eventual three-peat Bulls.  While Ceballos would blossom into a go-to player for the Lakers, and was on a solid run of 18-8 prior to getting hurt, he was not yet that All-star in Phoenix, similar to McGrady in Toronto or Harden in Oklahoma. Simply transposing later success onto an earlier rendition is asinine as Ceballos was not a made man, and had yet to break out. By all accounts Dumas was every bit the starting SF, putting up nearly 16ppg, 4.3 Reb 1.3stl 1.0blk per game, sandwiching a couple of 17pt games with a monster 20pt 12reb 5ast 2stl 3blk gm-1, and 25-5 in gm-5. Point is, he eclipsed whatever perceived production you think Ceballos would have given the Suns. Jordan still put up 41ppg for the single greatest finals output in history, Charles still struggled in games 1, 3, 5 and 6 and the Bulls still showed why being the defending Champs matters.	0

This is complete nonsense because the cdc isn‚Äôt lagging one week behind. The simple fact of the matter is that if you looked at any of the stats on coronavirus testing in the USA practically nobody was getting tested despite showing symptoms for the longest time.   Sk was testing even mild symptoms from the beginning and was tracking every single infected and doing targeted testing.   The USA has limited its testing to only those who are seriously ill and have known contact to a previously infected person. But if they haven‚Äôt been testing for infected people, then this dumbass attempt at testing based on known personal connections to a sick person has basically crippled any testing results the USA had in the past. Even if they catch up with testing 50k a day from today onwards it‚Äôs likely due to the exponential growth nature of the virus that the USA will be significant worse off than skorea and given the fact that Americans of younger ages have more comorbidities due to obesity related health issues, the USA is going to be much much worse off.  Italy is going to be a pisstake compared to the USA when the stats finally catch up after 2 weeks of 50k plus testing and overburdened hospitals.	0

Do you see a pattern? It may be nothing, but it is absolutely a pattern worth looking at.

everyone who thinks hagrid wouldnt be the uncontested goat is retarded. NBA players would look like Kevin Hart next to Yao Ming. Just fill your team with 4 defensive players and have someone throw a high ball across the field everytime you get the ball and you are like almost guaranteed to get 2 points every play. Or put him as the center on defense his reach is so big that noone could actually attempt a throw bc nobody can throw this high and be accurate.	0

"You seriously think Kobe is top 15? He's not even close, look at advanced stats for a second, if you're smart enough to understand them I mean.  Let me put down my classwork for my Advanced Applications in Statistics class at MIT Open Courseware for a second to teach you a little something about how mathematical models work. You probably couldn't even begin to comprehend how the models I work on in my spare time work, but I'll try anyway. It's good to pass on the knowledge, especially to those who are not well endowed in the analytical side of things.  You must be one of those Lakers fans that thinks championships are actually important, completely ignorant to the fact that any legendary player (Duncan anyone?) would take a 55 FG% than some useless jewelry ring anyday.  You don't know anything about the PER valuations and the metrics used to accentuate intricate sample sets about autonomous principles that can be extracted to show that Kobe Bryant has never actually hit a game winner in his career. All his game winners are media hype tapes to sell shoes. Kobe is very fortunate that he's marketed so well by Nike and the Lakers franchise.  ESPN and the whole 'next Jordan' narrative has you thinking Kobe is clutch but he's not, every data point that was graphed on the Cartesian plane while prime factorization was allowed to exist in a null factor showed that Kobe continued to fail theses primitive tests. I studied statistical variations in geometric localities and each and every one of their correspondent asymptotic differentiations provided me with the conclusion that your so called Kobe is the worst clutch shooter in the NBA.  Cosine functions developed at Princeton while combined with the Bell curve allows us to measure basketball production without affecting Higgs Boson-like particles that would otherwise exist in non-zero environments. And where do you think Kobe ranks on that scale? The bottom of the Bell Curve. They ran about ten thousand trials of the same repeating polymorphic routes emulating artificially generated synergy optimization and the Mamba was nowhere to be found in either planes. ""Eye tests"" are a layman's tool for avoiding thinking and this kind of narrow tunnel vision only exacerbates current falsifications that we can rely on such a poor method of extrapolation. I don't watch basketball but the fact of the matter is that I don't need to. It's all in the stats. The numbers don't lie.  Your ""Kobe"" is just an average NBA player who gets an ungodly amount of touches thanks to his marketing. Kobe was never the best player in the league, nor even a top 250 player in the league at any point in his career. I wish people understood more the numbers side of basketball and woke up and finally realized that this guy not only is overrated, but flat out isn't good at basketball in any way whatsoever"	1

They won more games against the pistons in 89 than in 88. They took the pistons to 6 games in 89. Pippen had 9 steals and 8 blocks in that 6 game series. He shot 67% ts against the knicks as well. Although he did struggle offensively against the world championship pistons. No one took them past 6 that year at all. they swept the lakers in comparison.  Cj doesn‚Äôt provide the defensive versatility of Pippen, who even in his second year he was averaging 2 steals and a block a game. CJ knows that he has to show up on offense to be a positive on the outcome of the game. Pippen provided a lot to the bulls even in his rookie year. His size and court coverage were impressive. He averaged 1.2 steals and .7 blocks on just 20 minutes.    My argument is that MJ needed Pippen to get to the finals/wcf. So saying that Lillard is not clutch when he hasn‚Äôt been to the finals is somewhat ridiculous in my opinion. Even in his rookie season MJ was making game winners in clutch time. If his team was never good enough to get to the finals in hindsight, MJ would still be clutch as a person. Judging clutchness by finals appearance, is IMO the sign of being ignorant that titles are a team achievement, not a player achievement by and large. Like I would say Gilbert arenas was clutch, but he barely made the playoffs.	1
"Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson is the best passer of all time     A revolutionary player who brought unique skills at the point guard position,Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson is the greatest passer in the NBA History      He made passing an art form and took it on a whole new level like few have.His ability to dish the ball in so many different way such as no looks,behind the back and so on.His rare assist numbers don't tell always the story      His court vision was phenomenal,one of the top ever.He was the best at sharing the rock on the fast brake as many highlights are the proof for that.In terms of style,no one is better than Johnson.He had such a flare      Not only that he had rare assist numbers,but according to his team mates back in the day Kareem and Worthy,he gave you room to do your magic while he was leading you to the easy points     He captured 4 assist titles,led the league 3 times in assists through his career.In the playoffs,he had even higher averages that made a lot of impact for sure.His career total of¬†10141 dimes is 4th on the all time list but his career average of 11.2 is the best ever      Let's not forget his 12.1 dimes in the playoffs as well"	0

"I edited my comment to give you an example of what I'm trying to explain. I don't know if you read it before replying to I'm going to copy paste it here.  > Edit: Here's an example that I hope my resonate with you. The [swastika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika) is the go to symbol of white hate groups, but when used by Hindus and Buddhists it represents love and peace. Context changes the meaning of a symbol because almost all simple symbols have versatile uses.   > That said a symbol representing one concept does not invalidate it's representation of another concept. If a swastika is used in a town with no Hinduism or Buddhism to be found then it's pretty easy to tell they're bigots in the community.  > What you're saying is that because the ""OK"" symbol is used by people to say ""you're good to go"" it can't also mean ""white power"" when used in a certain context. Which just doesn't make sense with any bit of logic involved.  Keep in mind you moving the conversation to Hitler is avoiding the issue at hand with whataboutism and further goalpost moving but I'll try to use your example.  Hitler taking pictures with his dog is one guy. Sure he's a horribly bigot monster but he's still one person. One person doing something doesn't make it a trend.  Now lets say people in hate groups made an active effort to buy one kind of dog; lets say bulldog. They then constantly make efforts to take group pictures with their bulldogs, posting those pictures in connection to bigoted comments, mentioning their bulldogs during their sentencing for hate crimes, their clothing has patches of bulldogs on them, etc.  Well when that happens you have a clear indication that with regards to white nationalists the bulldog is a hate symbol.  This scenario doesn't mean that taking pictures with dogs is racist, or that having a bulldog is racist, it just means that if someone who you already expected possibly being a bigot is making an effort to bring up/show bulldogs then you have further reason to suspect them.   So lets say you have that politician who constantly supports programs that negatively impact minorities and he's always rocking a bulldog tie or pin. Well, then you would want to look into his history and see if it's just a coincidence or maybe he has a history of bigotry, possibly even a connection to a hate group that's gone under the radar  But in our world a large number of bigots have never appropriated dogs or pictures with them into being a symbol of white supremacy so this isn't true. Instead we have the fact they've clearly adopted the ""OK"" symbol to be used as a signal of white supremacy.   As such when being used by a bigot it's a hate symbol even if it wouldn't be when used by someone else. That's how context works."	1

There will be times when it feels like the darkness is too much. Each day when the death tolls climb, when the unemployment rates continue to surge, when the next news story of a hate crime breaks, it might feel as if the negativity is insurmountable.  >But please, if you‚Äôre feeling hopeless, even right now, remember you‚Äôre not alone in this.

aren't there cases of people who have gone through transgender surgery and find out later that they weren't actually transgender in the first place? I remember watching this video a few weeks ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLewBHur61Q  At the same time I know people like Kim Petras that did surgery at a young age, 16 before puberty hit her and is living her best life right now. Personally I feel identifying as transgender is fine for a kid, but I'm not so sure on decisions in regards to surgery because there's no turning back.	1

folks don't grasp defensive schemes in the NBA at all, but the mavs played pure zone over 30% of the time that year and were tops in the league  they definitely gave people a different look and clogged the paint but in the finals they were allowed to be way more physical with lebron than anyone else.	0
Team wasn‚Äôt that bad. They just miscast their talent on offense and had Sabonis and Oladipo spot up from 3 to max Russ(point+rebound+assist). That‚Äôs why okc is better this year without him and Oladipo and Sabonis went on to be all stars	0
"The very connotation of ""No homo"" is that being homo is something bad or to be ashamed of that you need to specifically say you're not that.   Imagine if someone said ""I like watermelon"" and then followed it up with ""No black person"". That'd be totally fucked up right? There's nothing wrong with liking watermelon and it's narrow minded to make a statement that specifically links it to a black person. In that same vein there's nothing wrong with admiring or praising another person of the same gender and it's narrow minded to make a statement that doing so is explicitly homosexual in nature.   No one's stopping you from saying ""jokes"" but don't be surprised when people assume you're an asshole for telling them.  Edit: If trying to be a little empathetic and more accepting is too much for your pride you do not need to respond to this trying to justify your immature behavior to me. I'm not trying to force beliefs on anyone, rather just educate and maybe help someone see why saying ""No homo"" is considered offensive. The world is already a mean enough place.  Edit 2: Thank you reddit for repeatedly stating that homosexuality and being black are not the same thing. No kidding! I never said they were, but both the homosexual community and the black community have faced discrimination for who they are which is why I tried to use the example I did to illustrate how both types of ""joking"" are wrong. Also, there are no thought police and no one is going to prevent you from being a hateful vulgar piece of shit. I apologize for having the audacity for wanting to help spread a little empathy and explain why something like ""no homo"" could come off as being hurtful and offensive to people."	1

"I dont think anyone who has the choice between a sink w/ soap and hand sanitizer is arguing hand sanitizer does it better. what IS being argued is when sink w/ soap isnt nearby, sanitizer IS a safe and convenient option to use when 60% alc or more. running down halls or to another building or wherever its obviously not convenient is not good advice when you have a reliable method in hand sanitizer.  shitposting up and down saying ""wash your hands!!!!!"" in response to saying hand sanitizer works on a post about hand sanitizer not working is stupid. if its convenient and right there, wash your hands. If its not convenient and you have hand sanitizer, use a healthy amount and youre fine. if anything opening door handles out of the bathroom that carry germs is far more dangerous to risk than hands free squirts from a bottle that can air dry where you sit. no navigating or grabbing of door handles required at your desk or whatever. neither option is bad, but going out of your way to find a sink w/soap because you refuse hand sanitizer is retarded."	0

This is pretty much just pandering (the only thing DeBlasio knows how to do). Critically ill patients don't need testing either. Having the test result does nothing to alter the treatment for those people. They are treated exactly the same whether they are confirmed to have COVID-19 or not.  Its actually better to use the tests on healthy asymptomatic people you think might have been exposed because you can use the knowledge from the test to quarantine people who aren't showing symptoms.  So Bill, shut the fuck up and go back to being a useless piece of shit and let the grownups work.	0

This. Even with KLove‚Äôs and Irving‚Äôs defendive shortcomings, these three created historic offenses. The narrative of ‚ÄúJames making Love less effective‚Äù would be looked at completely differently had Love/Kyrie not been injured in 2015 and had KD not joined the Warriors in 2017.  In 2015, when they had some defenders (e.g., Shumpert who played was defending like a top 5 defensive wing),they could play both offense and defense. In their last 36 games together, they went 33-3 and had an SRS around +14 to +15.  2016 playoffs: +13 SRS (top 5 playoffs offense)  2017 playoffs: +14 SRS (best raw playoffs offense)  These are all time numbers, but sadly for them, the KD Added Turbo Warriors came about.  Take a look at these pairings:  Kobe/Shaq, +9.1, +10.9, +8.4, +10.1 in ‚Äò01, ‚Äò02, ‚Äò03, ‚Äò04 respectively; KD/Westbrook, +12.8 in 2016, +10.6 in 2015, +7.5 in 2014, +10.8 in 2013, +7.0 in 2012, +2.6 in 2011, +5.8 in 2010  James With Love, 2016,+12.0  James With Love, 2015, +11.8  James With Kyrie, 2015, +11.0  James With Kyrie, 2017, +10.2  James With Love, 2017, +10.1  Those are better numbers than the numbers Shaq and Kobe paired to put together. How can that be a failed pairing?  Lastly, about Love being ‚Äúmarginalized.‚Äù If you use a player to create an all time offense, how is he being marginalized?  2014 ‚ÄúMinny Love‚Äù per 100 possessions as a first option  35.4/17 on 59.1% TS  2017 Cavs‚Äô Love per 100 possessions as a third option  30.2/17.6 on 57.3% TS (took 2.1 fewer FGA/g per 100‚Äìequalize FGA and he‚Äôs at 32.6 ppg per 100 possessions)  2018 Cavs‚Äô Love per 100 possessions as a second option  30.8/16.2 on 61.4% TS (took 3.5 fewer FGA/g per 100‚Äìequalize FGA and he‚Äôs at 35.1 ppg AS A SECOND OPTION, almost identical to Minny Love as a FIRST OPTION; of course, with 3.5 more FGA per game, he‚Äôd basically be a co-first option with Bron)  All time playoff offensive series   Here‚Äôs a list of the best offensive series in NBA history (over the last 44 years at least); the Cavs have 5 of the top 29, i.e., 50% of all Cavs‚Äô playoff series since 2016 began have been in the top 1% of all playoff series played. They also have two best ever.  Cavs 2017 vs. Celtics, 128.4  Cavs 2018 vs. Raptors, 127.3  Suns 1995 vs. Blazers, 127.3  Bulls 1992 vs. Miami, 126.7  Lakers 1987 vs. Nuggets, 125.1  Suns 2005 vs. Grizzlies, 124.8  Lakers 1985 vs. Suns, 124.6  Lakers 1988 vs. Mavs, 124.6  Lakers 2010 vs. Suns, 124.2  Magic 1996 vs. Pistons, 123.7  Magic 1996 vs. Hawks, 123.1  Cavs 2016 vs. Hawks, 122.9  Lakers 1986 vs. Spurs, 122.7  Thunder 2016 vs. 122.5  Lakers 1989 vs. Blazers, 122.4  Warriors 2017 vs. Spurs, 122.2  Lakers 1984 vs. Mavs, 121.9  Jazz 1997 vs. Clippers, 121.7  Lakers 1987 vs. Warriors, 121.7  Bulls 1991 vs. Pistons, 121.6  Celtics 1986 vs. Bulls, 121.4  Warriors 2017 vs. Cavs, 121.3  Spurs 2017 vs. Memphis, 121.0  Bulls 1993 vs. Hawks, 121.0  Spurs 2014 vs. Miami, 120.8  Rockets 1995 vs. Jazz, 120.6  Cavs 2016 vs. Pistons, 120.4  Cavs 2017 vs. Raptors, 120.3  Magic 1995 vs. Pacers, 120.2	0

Wilt truly was a freak of nature. He‚Äôs probably the only player from the 50‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs that you could place in the NBA today, without giving him the advantages that athletes have today in terms of modern technology,  equipment, training, etc that would still be a force to be reckoned with. That‚Äôs how far ahead he was of everyone else from his time athletically.	0

He averaged more turnovers than assists, did you forget to put that part in?

Big kid parent checking in. Born at 10lbs, gained nearly a pound a week until he was 24lbs at 4 months. He's about the same size now as his brother that's 3.5 years older.   Rude kids at the park will call him a 'retard' because they think he's 7 or 8 but still talks like a 4 year old. So, that's always fun to deal with.	0
Tough because they are probably the 2 best Centers in the NBA. Both players can't seem to stay in shape and look winded towards the end of the game. Embiid is hands down a better defender and scorer. Jokic is a better playmaker and is more durable when it comes to injuries. It's tough but if I had to pick, I say Embiid because when fully healthy, he's Hakeem 2.0. His raw skills to dominate the position on both the offensive and defensive is unstoppable.	0

You retard everyone was downplaying it in February and even in March. Nancy Pelosi told people to go out and not worry Feb 24, De Blasio was telling people the same thing the second week of March. The Democrats literally blocked the aid bill and instead submitted one thousands of pages long packed with identity politics bullshit, they literally tried to hold the country hostage during a pandemic. Trump has press conference every day not downplaying the severity, he‚Äôs not responsible for anyone‚Äôs death. The endless hyperbole with you lot is exhausting.	0
