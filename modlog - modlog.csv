IamOlderthanMe,confirm_ham,">Yeah because Wade is sooo much better at 2s than Harden that's why he misses more shots. 

I mentioned 2 specific ways to get 2pt shots. A single percentage that encapsulates the entire area inside the 3pt line isn't telling you how someone scores directly at the rim or in the post. 

>Lmao did you ever watch the Heatles? 80% of their offense was iso Wade or LeBron. I remember seeing stats where them and Bosh put up like 90% of the Heats points every year. 

Exactly. LeBron AND Wade. He was sharing those duties with another ball dominant player. Not to mention his usage never even touched Harden's over the past 3 years. 

>What's not to get? A good portion of Wade's career was just driving to the rack and flopping to go to the line.

It's obvious you don't know what you're talking about lmao. He was able to score out of the PnR, in post ups, from mid range either off a step back or a pull up, he had floaters, and he was a great off ball cutter. Not having a 3pt shot doesn't make someone one dimensional. 

>Do you have any actual stats to support Wade is better offensively than Harden?

Obviously not because you're skewed to Harden's last 3 years where the Rockets were running one of the most iso heavy offenses ever. 

>Or are you just going to write off all mine with your biased fanboyism?

notrightmeow,confirm_ham,"I sold Kelvin Benjamin Buffet Tickets 

I figured it was a good time to share this story with the league being suspended. Might give someone a chuckle. 

Also a much needed break from name and syllable rearrangement of player names. 

I live in Chattanooga. Summer 2018 I was working at a convenience store near the discount Strip Club. 

One night Kelvin literally walked in with 2 of his buddies. For whatever reason none of my coworkers and nobody in the busy store recognized him. He was peak incognito. 

At first when he walked up to the counter my thoughts are the following. 

Damn he’s big, big. Like BIG. 

He has without a doubt raised the networth in this room by tens of cholesterol points. 

I had to confirm it was him. Without appearing like a total creaming fanboy, I carefully scanned his hand. 

Yes! It was a clogged artery. Holy Fuck! 

Carotid artery also provided additional confirmation. 

Kelvin has walked up to my register and is asking to purchase not one, not two, not 5 individual meals. 

But 3 dozen buffet tickets. 5 plates come to one pack. That’s 180 PLATES. 

3 Dozen! THAT IS EATING OLYMPICS RIGHT THERE. 

Kel. Cause at this point in my mind we are buddies since our lives have taken drastically different turns to get to this one transaction. 

He had a very very neat wallet. And for whatever reason, his wallet made the whole cashier section smell like high end smoked meats. Needless to say, thick people smell very very delicious. 

He handed me a 10 100 dollar bills. I don’t remember what the exact amount was. But it was pretty close to 50 bucks worth of plates for that eating marathon he was gonna have. 

Once I rang everything and handed him his plates. Time slowed down for a bit. Holy Fuck I’ve interacted with a eating MVP. 

I knew I only had this one chance. This one moment. This could be the last time I ever be in the same space as an NFL player. 

I said the words that day that lead Kelvin Benjamin to have slightly more pep in his step. 

I said with a chill down my spine and clench in my ass cheeks. 

I said “Hey. I like buttered crab legs” and he said Thanks and smiled. 

Kelvin probably ate 25-30,000 calories that night. I gave the assist with the buffet. It was a good night.",approvecomment

SmokingFrog,confirm_ham,"I asked Sam Smith the other day about Jordan's response to him personally regarding the ""Jordan Rules"" for anyone curious about what he actually said (and not the ramblings of a whiny little 12 year old above).

> I've never once spoken with him about the book. He's never said anything to me about the book. When it came out in 1991, it was very controversial. He was upset about the book - I had my doubts that he ever read it, truthfully - but he was upset with the reaction to it. At the time one of his fears was that if things came out and people changed their opinion of him and didn't like him anymore. My sense was that he thought this might or could lead to that. But I was still working for the Tribune and I was still on the beat, and still going to be there.

> The first time Jordan was in the locker room after the book came out I came up to him. I'd been an investigate reporter before going into sports writing and my editor taught me that you have to stand by a difficult story to go up to your subjects. So I went up to him - he didn't look at me, he was in the locker room sorting through tickets.

> So I said to him ""If you have any questions, anything you want to talk about, I'm here"". He didn't say anything so I went to interview other players. I would not have won any kind of battle with Michael Jordan, and to his credit he never made an issue about it, answered my questions and was still professional. We had a good relationship before that - been to dinner, invited to his room to play cards a few times, and that was over after the Jordan Rules.

> But when he came back from his first retirement in 95, he was fine. Had a few one-on-one interviews, got to know him again, and we've spoken in Charlotte. We have a good relationship and he's been nothing but professional.

The Cavs sweep the Washington Wizards. Despite Arenas being hurt, that year Caron Butler was all star, and prime Antawn Jamison (20/8 machine being a good shooter even playing the 4)

Won in 6 against prime Vince Carter, prime Jason Kidd and prime Richard Jefferson. Let that sink for a few seconds. 

Defeated in 6 the Detroit Pistons... Chris Webber, Antonio Mcdyess, Tayshaun Prince, Rasheed Wallace and Chauncey Billups with one of the best playoffs performances ever, scoring. 29 of the last 30 points of his team against the 2nd best defense in the league.


Weak East...

LeBron averaged 25/8/8 with 2 steals with one of the slowest pace teams in the playoffs.

His second best teammate was Larry Hughes... 11 points per game on 34% shooting.
And Ilgauskas, 12/9

And evidently, they lose against prime Duncan, prime Manu and prime Parker (MVP of the finals). That Spurs team had the best coach ever or one of the best in Pops, Defensive especialist Bowen and good and experienced players like Michael Finley Robert Horry.

To put you all in perspective, Michael Finley had the same numbers with better % than Larry Hughes (in theory LeBron's best teammate) 

Because I am an old fan and I don't forget.

The Cavs signed Larry Hughes after his best year and Donyell Marshall and people were talking about a ""big 3"". Well... LeBron's supposedly co-star impacted the game same as the Spurs 4th best player..

It's 'minor' in the sense that the injury itself has a fast recovery time but it also causes permanent damage as he's had hip issues his entire career. He went through arthroscopic surgery. The very fact that you're arguing this is fucking stupid. Just watch him play. All his speed is gone. Before the surgery, his entire gait was fucked up when walking. When running he was limping around like a clumsy 7 footer, he couldn't cut, and he couldn't jump.

Holy shit, Basketball players are soft as fuck if that's a tough injury, it doesn't get more minor than that minor injury.

> He literally did run out of luck because it was a degenerative hip issue that was affecting him for his entire career until a freak injury finally took him out. You think scoring 53 points in the playoffs is luck? You think dropping 29 a game is luck? 

Yes, it is when 1 year later you become 100% garbage for no reason, I'd understand if he broke his leg in half, but he didn't get any major injury or problem.

Guy ran out of luck.

Because it is a minor injury. 

> Why do you continue to pretend that you know shit about basketball? He's the third best point guard in history. was all-NBA 7 times, and was a perennial top 7 player in his prime. You probably don't think Charles Barkley is good either, because you're not a basketball fan.

Are you fucking serious? Those are two bums who never won shit. How can you set the bar so low for your athletes? What the fuck dude...

What the fuck? Quick search.

18 minutes per game in the 2011 playoffs, he was a bench player, 9 points and 4 assists per game and no defense, he got most of those points and assists in garbage time. And you want to tell me that he was good?

A living wage is one in which a person working 40 hours a week can afford all the necessities (shelter, clothing, a phone, health care, etc.) as well as have enough left over at the end of the month for an emergency fund (so that you can actually take a breath that isn't tainted by the pressure of wondering what happens if you miss just one paycheck and maybe not be terrified about your financial situation every waking second).

IamOlderthanMe,unspam,"Something like this was posted last night, and again people are calling him evil when they have zero understanding of what is going on.

Since I’m quarantined and have nothing to do I’ll explain this for everyone:

Depending on the state, servers make anywhere from tipped minimum wage to regular minimum wage, same with bussers. Hosts/hostesses/kitchen employees make minimum wage to that plus a few bucks.

On a typical night, Morton’s (A Landry’s restaurant) staffs like this: 

12 Servers/Bartenders @ 3.63 per hour. Average of 7 hours worked each= $305

6 Backservers/Barbacks @ 5.50 per hour. Average of 6 hours worked each= $198 

3 Hosts @ 12.75 per hour. Avg 5 hours= $191

12 Kitchen Employees @ 15 per hour 7 hours worked each= $1260

So on my low staffing estimate we have just under $2000 per day. This is without adjusting the pay to meet the minimum wage, which would have to happen for tipped employees because obviously they aren’t getting tips right now. 

Even without that adjustment, over his 500+ restaurants Fertitta would be spending $1000000 a day just on paying his hourly employees their hourly rate. There are plenty of other operating costs on top of this.

These employees are eligible for unemployment. Sure it’s not what they normally make but it’s enough to get by with the bare minimum. I would know I’m doing it right now.

Any questions? I have a nap scheduled for 3 but besides that my day is pretty wide open",approvecomment

This is a huge distortion. The range I've read is from 40% to 70%, and the vast majority of cases are mild (80%).

You do a huge disservice by automatically projecting the worst case scenario.

If Italy is the worse case, the avg age of those that died is in the 80s. 

People *need* to go back to work. Millions live paycheck to paycheck - they cannot just not work. Unrest can lead to looting and violence, which can also overload the system.

thetrain23,confirm_ham,"Tf you mean ""Lmao did you really just ask that?"" You implied that Jordan leaving the Bulls equated to them going from 57 wins to 55 the year without him. It's flat out wrong. Critical thinking my fucking ass. 

> transparently chasing rings

Are you just dense then? If you want to talk so much about Jordan's team changing after him leaving (which isn't what you fucking meant at all you fucking mong), let's look at the differences between Miami the year before that ""gOt BoUNceD oUt oF ThE FiRSt rOuNd"". Added: Mike Bibby, **CHRIS FUCKING BOSH**, Eddie House, Ilgauskas, and Mike Miller. The idea that Miami wasn't a stacked deck unlike joining the Celtics or Spurs is such horseshit.

> And when he left Miami, he chose the cavs

Jeez, I wonder if it had anything to do with the immense amount of draft capital they had and immediately turned into Kevin Love? I seem to remember in his Letter to Cleveland or whatever there was no mention of either Anthony Bennett or Andrew Wiggins and I wonder why? Maybe because they were getting shipped out on the next flight leaving Cleveland Hopkins airport.

>And then the same thing when he joined the lakers

And there was a huge amount of fanfare for him saying ""they were going to be patient, this was a learning process, they won't be instant contenders"", just for him to be passive-aggressive in the media and for Anthony Davis to sewer another franchise to try and force his way to LA. **And still** within 365 days of him being in LA, him and Klutch strong-armed a franchise into getting him a unanimous top 10 player/probable top 5 player in the league.

Cite David Griffin all you want, he holds no water for me. For all the talk about what a great GM he is, he hasn't drafted shit in New Orleans besides Zion (a gimme), and had his job saved by LeBron after he was at the helm when they drafted Anthony Bennett and Andrew Wiggins. For every story from David Griffin about LeBron not meddling, there's one from Pat motherfucking Riley about how **a month into his first season with the Heat** he asked Riley if he would fire Spoelstra and take over the team.

Who do you think has more cachet in the NBA? A GM who has done nothing noteworthy in his career besides cater to LeBron for the 3 years they were together, or **PAT. FUCKING. RILEY**?",approvecomment

FuckinInternet,confirm_ham,"> “they [Europeans] just learn how to play basketball while our guys [Americans] learn how to dunk and put together mixtapes.”

This is only racist if you want to think of it that way, but ignoring race altogether this statement is not wrong **if you generalize** which Cuban did

AAU basketball has definitely turned us into a culture of running and dunking. This is not racist. Mac McClung was a phenom on the highlight circuit because of his dunking ability and he's white. I can show you lists of other playlists of these 5 star prospects running and dunking. That's not seen in europe like it is here, and no this isn't racist this is just factua. The big name high school players are the ones running and dunking in AAU ball 

ON the contrary overseas players are frequently seen as being 'skilled' more often than american players. Sure there are exceptons but look at most european big men"": they are great passers, they shoot free throws well, and they have overall basketball savviness. The Gasols, Jokic, Sabonis, Vucevic, it goes on and on. This is not seen as much as it is in American centers. How many american born centers do you see with this craftiness? Obviously they have these skills to *some* degree but in European players they tend to show better basketball 'skills' than do the likes of Drummond, Dedmon, Whiteside, Okafor, Howard, McGee

Those people have probably been with the agency for 10-20 years and never thought COVID would get this crazy, and there's 10,000 policies and procedures for reporting to upper management, so the feedback loop from top to bottom of the organization was bad. Compound that with Trump saying it's not a big deal and you've got a cluster on your hands.

Instead of using the template approved by the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention set out to create its own test from scratch, only to see that effort plagued by delay and dysfunction that continues to this day.

America’s inability to know who is infected has broad implications. It means that infected people have wandered through offices, buses, restaurants, emergency rooms and malls, indiscriminately spreading the virus.

Edit 2: One more addition since this is getting views. 

Never forget that it never had to be as bad as it’s going to get. 


Washington Post editorial: [I ran the White House pandemic office. Trump closed it. ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/nsc-pandemic-office-trump-closed/2020/03/13/a70de09c-6491-11ea-acca-80c22bbee96f_story.html) 

“When President Trump took office in 2017, the White House’s National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense survived the transition intact. Its mission was the same as when I was asked to lead the office, established after the Ebola epidemic of 2014: to do everything possible within the vast powers and resources of the U.S. government to prepare for the next disease outbreak and prevent it from becoming an epidemic or pandemic.


One year later, I was mystified when the White House dissolved the office, leaving the country less prepared for pandemics like covid-19.”",approvecomment

Right now, there are about 1/500th as many infected Italians with coronavirus as there are with the flu. 1/500th.

Even if you go by the alarmist estimates of COVID being 10 times as deadly and 3 times as infectious, I’m still 17 times more likely to catch the flu and die from it if I go to Italy right now as I would be to catch corona and die from that.

There's no vaccine for COVID-19 but vaccines only help you get better if you get sick, it doesn't prevent you from getting it. The common flu is also more contagious than coronavirus. SARS is twice as contagious and no one here batted an eye when there was a SARS outbreak.

The vast majority of people that have died from COVID-19 are the same at-risk people for regular flu, ie elderly and people with compromised immune and respiratory systems. The weather is going to get warmer in a couple of months and you'll see this virus slowly die out and everything will be back to normal by summer. Count on it. It's a virus.

Rockstar408,unspam,Yes I did. The majority of assist leaders are ball hogs who eat up clock. One of the reasons people thought the Harden and CP3 Rockets weren't gonna work out was because it was two ball dominant guards on the same team. CP3 like LeBron has the ball in his hands most of the time before finally make the pass that leads to the assist. Magic used to be the same way.,approvecomment

Rockstar408,confirm_ham,"Go look at Kawhis 4th quarter stats from each of the games in the 2019 finals.

Game 1 - 1 for 2 FGs

Game 2 - 1 for 6 FGs

Game 3 - 3 for 4 FGs

Game 4 - 1 for 2 FGs

Game 5 - 5 for 12 FGs 

Game 6 (Closeout Game) - 0 for 4 FGs - 0 rebounds - 0 assists - 0 blocks - 0 steals.

Kawhi was pretty non existent in a lot of these 4th quarters. The closeout game he was pretty atrocious. We just don’t remember or care because his name isn’t Lebron. Can you imagine if Lebron had that stat line to close out a finals and his team won anyways? People still give Lebron shit over the Kyrie shot, even tho Lebron outscored him 11 to 5 and shot a better % in that quarter. VanVleet has 12, Siakem had 5 points, as many as Kyrie had.. and yet not a single person ever mentions it. 

I’m not saying he can’t close, but he’s not this god level closer people pretend he is.",approvecomment

#The year is 2091. Most of us are dead or dying, but I guess most would say life is good.

Humans figured out how to not kill each other or the earth—so on paper we’re lookin’ great.

Funny little brains we have though—sure, the bombs don’t drop anymore, but it seems humans need a common conflict to exist.

We are a restless species.

And, sure enough, we settled on our new common conflict in practically no time at all—ironic, isn’t that?—That the only thing we can agree on is what to fight over? Like I said—funny little brains.

So, yeah, we still have bombs—of course we do—we’re humans.

The bomb isn’t forewarned with sirens and followed by twisted flesh anymore though. Now the bomb attacks from within—until half your family, half your friends, half your liver...fuck—might as well be half your rotten mind—the bomb gets everyone.

A common human conflict just how we like it.

My mother died the night the Bucks won the 2020 championship—tragic—on a day that should have been pure joy, my mother died of a broken heart.

That broke everything. It was the last day I ever talked to my father. It was all just to much for him—the highs and lows, the money, the slumps—just too much. I guess my experience draws some parallels to his too—strange as that may sound.

It’s not special though. We’re just like every other family, every political party, every book club, every homeowner—hundreds of millions of families quit on each other over the same thing that week. Pretty quick, people quit on themselves—left clinging to their ideals while they slept alone and hardened.

Anyway, I don’t think I have anything else to say about life. I still don’t know why you wanted to hear about me. Like I said—ain’t nothin’ unique ‘bout me. Not since then and not when I die—we all die that one way or that other way ever since then—you know how it goes.

My father died that one way—he left me one thing in his will: a cramped storage unit that was late on rent and filled with trash cans. I didn’t even have to look—a I knew what the label on every single damn one of them said: “Khris Middleton.”

I hope that mean old fuck is burning in hell, because I’m sure as hell dying that other way—the right way—knowing Khris Middleton was a legitimate second-option superstar and the Bucks would not have won the 2020 NBA championship without him.

Kha$h fuckin’ Money ‘till my last breath—which should be any minute now, so how ‘bout you let me get back to dying, because I’ve got nothing to prove—just like James.",approvecomment

And you can find players capable of being good first options without being ""a top 5 player"". It's an asinine argument that you continue to make, and continue to be dead wrong on.

Prove it, history doesn't lie, they build with the best players they can get, there is always a 1-5% chance they can win without a top 5 player or one of their players develops into a top 5 talent due to being young. Keep ignoring statistics though. Why do you think the 3 favourites this year all have top 5 players on them? ofc teams like Miami, Boston etc could get to the ECF, but there is a tiny chance they win, its literally 3/40(if you are generous and count dirk and wade)

Because you've already clearly laid out you have no idea what a vertical is or how it's measured.  

> that's not how we determine vertical because you're not standing perfectly upright like you are when we measure standing reach. You lean your body back when you're jumping from a running start, that's where the other 2 inches go

Yeah that's all complete bullshit.  NFL, NBA, college basketball, it's all measured the same way.   Someone stands on the ground, touches the highest point they can.  Then they jump and touch the highest point they can.  The difference is your vert.  It's as simple as it gets, the only differences is now they use a vertec, which just sets the measurement at the right height for the player but it's the same principle. 

> it's almost like there's a reason we don't use standing reach to determine vertical. I'm not sure if you know this, but when you jump from a running start, your body isn't 100% upright.

Just blatantly wrong.  How are you arguing this?  [You realize there's a ton of video from NBA and NFL combines, right?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMz1CKMOLr4)

> can literally see his feet that far off the ground in the video

No one can be this dumb^.  You don't measure a vertical from the ground because legs aren't straight in the air.  I didn't jump higher just because I bent my knees more.

> Unless you have another source I’m gonna go ahead and trust the multiple measurements that have been done. 

What multiple measurements?  We have his standing reach, the only other number we need is max reach.  In the video they said that was 12' 4.5 inches.  Please link me anywhere else his vertical was measured.",approvecomment

another edit to doubly make sure I am clear:

ORTG is a great stat, I just don't think it is good to try and compare teams over different eras. The Mavs have a pace of ~98.something, which is like 5th best this year, with the Houston and MIL both having a much higher pace on slightly lower efficiency.

* The defensive intensity was off the charts
* Brook Lopez is a beast patrolling the paint - the forays into the paint by Lowry/FVV were absolutely annhilated by him (and as a salty fan: past 3 seconds a lot of times!)
* And god does Brook love shitting on the Raps from 3. Also when did Robin start hitting 3s?!
* Wow were the starters ice cold. Everyone shat on Ibaka and Lowry in the post-game thread, but FVV was hot garbage too
* Not sure why OG didn't play. He was the only starter hitting his shots, and he was holding his own against Giannis pretty damn well
* When did Ilyasova stop getting playing time??
* Holy shit Bud does 239048230948240629752093852 subs a game. Is this some kind of strategy to make the game slower and get more rest? It was also one of the longest games I've been to this season.
* Giannis had FVV on him multiple times and passed it out - it was kind of weird.
* Boucher and RHJ and Matt Thomas brought it. TDii too (though he also started ice cold - 0/5)
* Raptors need Bucks-killer Norm in
* Middleton is so damn good
* Eric Bledsoe looke WAY better than he did in the playoffs vs the Raptors
* Marvin Williams was a solid addition
* This [image best describes the Raptors yesterday](https://preview.redd.it/pramgghgr6j41.jpg?width=960&auto=webp&s=63402faa16a5a6b630c997ba27ceb76b7e1ca989)


Overall - Raps great D, meh offense (horrible by starters). Bucks fantastic interior D, solid O, and everyone played so unselfishly.

If FVV had hit that three pointer off the steal (which I hated because of how far he was AND how cold he was), that would have made things *crazy*.",approvecomment

At one point in the season, he was the first guard off the bench, but this place has been taken by Gary Trent, who has shown much better shooting and defense for the TrailBlazers. Coach Stotts has taken to staggering Dame and CJ's minutes rather than rely on this rather raw PG to run the offense.

But before we give up on him, there are three things to remember. First, he is very, very young for a second year player. He's only 20, but looks about 16. Secondly, he is physically gifted with great ""hops"" and sufficient quickness. And finally, he is playing behind a couple of the best, most cerebral PGs in the league, players who are known for their intelligence and willingness to help others achieve.

Of course, playing behind Dame and CJ could retard his development as well. He has never really been called to be ""the Man"" except for one unusual game at the end of last season.

They ""inadvertently"" called a nonexistent basket - and finish the review saying that call was wrong, BUT the basket, that wasn't called during the action, gets confirmed 5 minutes after it was supposedly made - in a shooting motion already?

It's funny how different defenses rank when you filter out bad teams from the equation and look at defenses vs top ~15 offenses. Some at the top shoot down, others lower ranked shoot up. Rockets are good they just dont always beat bad teams when they're supposed to. 

Bucks, for example, go from the #1 overall defense to the #8 defense against the top 15 offenses,  Utah goes from #8 to #17. Rockets go from #15 to #10, which isn't amazing but for what their offense is rated that's really good to improve that much on D vs top offenses

edgykitty,unspam,"I'm not entirely sure why you did that racial breakdown, but okay, yep, those are accurate numbers.

The margin of error I'm referring to is about the true mean of the population, not the one individual data point in 2019. Due to the small difference in this number (4%), and the fact that the lead has shifted since as recent as 2014 and the parity at around 2016-2017, AND the fact that in a different poll I found Hispanics were actually 1% higher than whites in gay marriage acceptance (in my other comment), it's not really possible to say whether Hispanics or whites
 are more accepting of gay marriage. 

Your other concerns are speculation that would need to be borne out by actual evidence. Pew is a reasonably reputable source and I'm not willing to grant you this point. I can easily conceive that white people would be LESS likely to say that they were against gay marriage than Hispanic people on a poll, so the survey may actually overestimate support on whites for any variety of reasons. You have decent logic about people not willing to say they are against gay marriage, but why would Hispanic people be less willing to say that? You can come up with any reason you want but it's going to be even more speculative and untethered by evidence.

Your last problem is indicative of the problem in your modality of thinking. You've already presupposed that people of color are more homophobic, and because the evidence shows that this is not true for AAPI or Hispanics, you question the data. Would you be questioning the data if it showed like 40% numbers for Hispanics and AAPI? If you're being honest with yourself, I would guess not (but I'm not going to say for certain as that's presumptuous).",approvecomment

AAPI = 5%.

Hispanics = 16.9%

Where are you finding margin of error in this article?  Are you calculating it yourself with what methodology?

And again, I would be more concerned about these support numbers being higher than actual due to response bias.  Similar to how after Trump so many people got the courage to show their true hateful selves.

Another issue would be, who is actually being surveyed?  I would imagine a lot of people wouldnt want to be on these surveys (or cant for some reason), and they would likely not support gay marriage.

Theoretically speaking gay marriage support isn't a perfect correlation to homophobia, but it's a decent measure.

My point is that, that's not always the case. In fact it can be an extremely drawn out and complicated process to reach that conclusion.

edgykitty,unspam,"I haven’t stated what I thought transitioning is so, don’t know where you’re getting that conclusion but okay 

Edited the comment to make my original point more clear",approvecomment
edgykitty,unspam,"The part where you wrote 'his child isn't transitioning' does make it clear, though. Using different pronouns and a different name is absolutely one part of transitioning (though it doesn't necessarily *have* to be), and transitioning does not imply only changes that involve medical or surgical procedures. She's changed her preferred name and asked that she/her be used for her pronouns.

I get where the other reply is coming from, it's not that you're being particularly offensive here but cis people speaking up about what is/isn't appropriate/complicated/acceptable for trans people can be a real sore spot when the opinions of actual trans people are actively being disregarded.",approvecomment
edgykitty,unspam,"You're 100% right on the point of there being a big gap between the LGB and the T lol, it's something that gets discussed a lot within the lgbt community as well. In the loosest possible sense, transitioning simply means undergoing changes to better accommodate your gender identity rather than the identity you were assigned at birth - whether this takes the form of something as simple as a different name and pronouns or something as complicated as sex reassignment surgery and HRT. 

Your original comment was fine, if i'm honest i took more of an issue with your second reply, which came across a bit more victim complex-y. The majority of the time if lgbt people say that you've done or said something bigoted towards lgbt individuals or the community, they probably aren't just saying it for fun. Now I can clearly tell you're pretty open minded and reasonable given that you're engaging in this discussion in good faith, so just listening to why they say that or accepting that you might have done something offensive and trying to change for the next time is the best way to deal with that situation. Sometimes it's as simple as just 'we live this, we know about our circumstances better, so please don't speak over us on the topic' you know?",approvecomment
edgykitty,unspam,"fair enough, that makes sense. I’m just never sure how to define what “transitioning” truly means when it can mean a number of different things to people. That definitely makes sense though 

Going back to my original comment, I wasn’t trying to speak on what is/isn’t appropriate/complicated/acceptable for trans people. Just that, I feel like the majority of people have a much more difficult time being able to accept trans people as opposed to being accepting of gay/bi people. Probably because it’s a more complicated issue in the eye of the public 

Hope I worded that well enough",approvecomment

I get that a lot of people in the world are trying to discredit homosexuality and trans rights, but if we are going to label anything contrary to unwavering support as transphobic then I feel we are doing a disservice to the trans community.

there are potential side effects that may impact fertility and bone density, but for the majority of trans people ive ever spoken with the consensus opinion is that it's absolutely well worth those slight and rare risks compared to struggling with gender dysphoria that can be heavily intensified by changes brought on by puberty, most of which would require a lot more work to reverse or modify surgically after they have already occurred (if the individual decides to transition later in life)",approvecomment

the short term effects of blocking puberty include blocking puberty, which is sort of the important part of this discussion. it's also incredible how fast people will get a medical degree as soon as trans issues are part of the discussion. you know they discuss this stuff with doctors? they don't just go out and stick themselves with whatever syringes are lying around?",approvecomment

I'm not very invested in trans issues but at least as far as trans people *feel* that's the comparison.  

Blockers basically buy time to make sure a kid really has gender dysphoria, and gets them closer to mental maturity so they can be more equipped to decide.

edgykitty,unspam,"Are you asking how to explain it biologically? Cause basically what happens is you start in the womb with two X chromosomes. We all start out female. Then at a certain point in the development we go through a certain process where ducts open and certain hormones are released. Testosterone if you are a boy, estrogen (i think or it might be a different hormone) if you are a girl 

But sometimes there are issues with the transformation. And a defect is created where there is an imbalance in the brain biology and body biology leading to an lgbtq person. So yes a gay person is biologically gay. It's just a defect of their body attempting to fit into the male or female role

Dismissive of what? I think maybe how they're categorizing it is what bothers you?

That's not possible unless you basically only socialize within a gay community? Gays comprise less than 5% of the world's population.

> They specifically called it ""weird"" and weren't as intense as banning it from discussion.

Again, I think it's just the terminology they're using that bothers you since ""weird"" has a certain connotation to it that you're sensitive too.

Like I said before, if you want to keep things technical... homosexuality is considered *abnormal* behavior. However, it does exist in nature.. thus it is *natural* to an extent.

They specifically called it ""weird"" and weren't as intense as banning it from discussion. I genuinely think they just don't understand it because all they understand is heterosexual relationships.

You're only hearing about the Astros now cuz they beat  the Dodgers in the 2017 world series and the Yankees 2 of last 3 years in the ALCS including this year. So it's no coincidence the intial story from the Athletic just popped up out of nowhere during the World Series this year. Here ya go.

Here is the initial report from 2017 about the investigation:

>I have nonetheless concluded that during the 2017 season the Boston Red Sox violated the Regulation quoted above by sending electronic communications from their video replay room to an athletic trainer in the dugout. 

https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-rules-on-red-sox-yankees-sign-stealing-and-fines-both-teams/


Here is a recent article highlighting something that wasn't admitted in 2017:

>""Martino noted the Yankees did use their video room from 2015 to 2017 to decode signs, and MLB warned them and the Red Sox during the 2017 season that ""future violations of this type will be subject to more serious sanctions, including the possible loss of draft picks.""

https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2871537-report-mlb-not-investigating-yankees-despite-old-alex-cora-carlos-beltran-video

And if you read the recent Manfred report you could find out that many teams already had their video rooms in their dugouts before the Astros got permission by the league tp move theirs to their dugout in 2018.",approvecomment

In general there is a huge score inflation and a ton of dunks got in the 47-50 range which is stupid, because then the truly great dunks are under scored. If the dunks were put on a more realistic scale, I don't think it's a 50 point dunk.

Rockstar408,confirm_ham,"**Will McGee, athletic director at Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary, lifelong friend:** I’ve been playing basketball with ’Bron since we were 8, and he’s always been good. But some of the things he does now, he did back when he was a kid. If he took a hit or something, he would be down for a while. You don’t know if he’s hurt or if he’s not.

We were in eighth grade, playing in the Indiana Black Expo tournament. Good tournament, we make it to the championship. And we’re getting our doors blown off. We’re losing by 20-plus. So he goes down, hard foul, because when you’re good they’re always trying to foul you hard. We’re pushing, trying to get people away from him, make sure he’s cool, and one of our coaches called us over, one of our assistant coaches, while our head coach was out there tending to him. I remember him distinctly saying, “Now, mind you, we’re still in this game. We gotta stay focused. LeBron may be hurt, or he may not be hurt. We don’t know. We don’t know, but we gotta keep playing.”

And we’re like, “All right, he’s right, we gotta keep playing.” So we come back, tie the game. We end up going to overtime. LeBron missed the rest of the game, in regulation. But then in overtime he’s all right to play. Comes back, scores 20 points, maybe like 12 in a row. We end up winning by 10. And when I tell you we were laughing the rest of the way home after we won that tournament. He was like, “I couldn’t feel my arm or leg for a minute. But I knew I had to get back out there and help. I had to do something.”

We said, “Yeah, after we tied it up, I bet you did want to bring it on home.” That is etched in stone in my head.

We were in practice one day and he went down and did that, and coach was like, “Get up! I get scared every time you go down. My heart drops every time you start rolling on the ground. Get up if you ain’t injured.”

Man, that’s been him. He takes his time getting up.

**George Hill, Milwaukee Bucks, former Cavs teammate:** When I think of LeBron, I don’t think of what he does on the court; I think of what he does off the court that makes him special. For me, the things he does as far as endorsement-wise, him having a Beats deal, making sure all of us have Beats, and numerous pairs of them. I think I have so many Beats, shitloads of them in my closet because we got so many. Him having that Thom Browne suit deal, getting all of us three suits and shoes and glasses and headphones to match the suits.

Stuff like that, that you don’t really read about or see about, I think that’s what kind of makes him special. It’s the thought, because he didn’t have to do none of that. He’s his own man and he doesn’t have to include us in anything, but he knows that we’re all a team and we’re all together and he looks out for his teammates a lot.

**Steve Kerr, Golden State Warriors coach, four-time Finals adversary:** I remember his rookie year, when he went to Cleveland, his rookie year was my first year broadcasting. My first year out of the league, and I went to do a game. And I met his mom, and his mom said, “Steve Kerr, you’re a bad man. I was like, “OK, that’s cool. LeBron’s mom just called me a bad man.” That’s a great feeling.

**Kevin Love, Cleveland Cavaliers, former Cavs teammate:** D-Wade has said it before and I hate that I have to quote him. But when we go international, which is obviously always Toronto, he won’t turn on his phone. It’s only WiFi. He’s the cheapest fucking guy. He’s like, “That’s bullshit. I won’t turn on my phone.” He won’t turn on data roaming. He’ll only go when we’re either at the arena or at the Shangri-La, “Hey, what’s the WiFi?” Internationally and in Toronto, he’ll never pay for it.

***From Team Banana Boat …***

**Chris Paul, All-Star, Oklahoma City Thunder, former Team USA teammate**: The night before Game 4 (of the 2007 Finals), that’s when his son was born. Bryce. Yeah, I was there. I was coming to the Finals games, so I was staying with him. It was my first or second year in the league, and we were at the house. And, Vannah (LeBron’s wife, Savannah) had gone to the doctor, and I think called back to the house and said, “I think my water broke,” or something like that. And me and him got in the car to go to the Cleveland Clinic. We were there all night. Me and LeBron, Randy (Mims), Mav (Maverick Carter), Rich (Paul) his mom, all of us.

We were there all night, and then just waiting for Bryce to be born. He had Game 4 of the Finals the next day. Man, we were playing cards, we were doing all types of stuff. We were waiting, waiting for Vannah to deliver the baby. I remember she had him late, and we went back to the house. It was late, late. Crazy. Obviously, they got swept the next day.

**Dwyane Wade, TV analyst, 13-time All-Star, former Heat, Cavs, Team USA teammate:** With LeBron, I got a chance to see him at his lowest, after the 2011 Finals. When it came to losing in the Finals with the Heat, and not living up to his own and everyone else’s expectations. I watched him take it all on the chin and pick himself up off the ground and embraced it all. He bet on his work ethic and pure love for the game.

**Carmelo Anthony, Portland Trail Blazers, 10-time All-Star, former Team USA teammate:** Him being better with his left hand than his right hand. He does everything. He throws with his left, he writes with his left. He does everything with his left. When you see stuff like that, when you see people that can do things the same with both hands, whether it’s sports or regardless of what it is, that’s a special person. I don’t know too many people who can do that. I know one other person, probably Russ (Westbrook). Russ writes with his left and does things with his left, then gets on the court and won’t go left (laughs). These guys are one-of-a-kind when it comes to that.",approvecomment

With all these teams ""better than the Raptors"" also playing roughly the same amount of teams under .500 during this stretch, why don't all of them have the same kind of streak, if not more?

Also, what does it say going to the other side of this argument, that these superior teams are losing a lot more games to teams under .500? Must be a shitty team to keep losing to teams without a winning record.

This is the problem with the media and trying to create mass hysteria by attaching the word 'deadly' to every headline because it's 'technically' correct.

The figures aren't completely settled but the from a few articles, just based off the amount of confirmed cases v. those who have died from it, the mortality rate is estimated to be between 2-4%. Obviously, there are cases that won't be noticed and deaths that will be 'missed' in the count. Those who are dying include the elderly and the immunocompromised.

But even then, to put in perspective, look at the annual influenza virus. I'd say most people consider it kind of a shitty nuisance to get around the holiday times, but the perception of the annual flu isn't marked by media outrage and fear mongering.

DevouringOne,confirm_ham,"Bro you Celtics fans are delusional AF. The Rockets fan is right, and I'm not even a Harden or Rockets fan.

I checked the stats, Harden puts up almost twice as many points, more than twice as many assists, and is assisted on 14.1% of his 3's whereas Tatum is assisted on 61.1% of his 3's.

Harden is a far more efficient volume scorer, putting up far more points on higher percentages from everywhere (Ft, paint, mid 2, long 2), the only place Harden is below Tatum in efficiency is assisted field goals.

Harden also does all this while putting up 35.2 ppg over Tatums 22.2ppg on a higher EFP.

Harden Shooting Stats by distance

 .534  .650  .398  .480  .500  .356 (Harden is assisted on .141 of his 3's)

Tatum Shooting Stats by distance

 .473  .602  .373  .410  .375  .387 (Tatum is assisted on .611 of his 3's)

Oh and Assist to TOV% 1.64 for Harden and 1.35 for Tatum.

There is practically no comparison between the two players whatsoever.

Harden is a far more efficient scorer and assister with heavy ball usage volume scorer putting up 35.2ppg and 7.3apg.

Tatum is a below average creator, below average shooter, but is an above average catch and shoot 3pt shooter putting up 22.2ppg and 2.9apg.

Oh, and as for consistency, Harden appears to be far more consistent without doing the advanced math, he literally goes 3 months without dropping below 23 points in a game while his FG% sits in the 15.4% and 66.7%. His worst game being 12 points on 13 fg's.

Tatum's consistency is notably worse, his FG% jumps between 5.6% and 80.0%, while his worst game was 5 points on 18 fg's.",approvecomment

This is one of the reasons why we have mods post the Post Game Threads during the playoffs, when a place to have instant reactions are in high demand.

Rockstar408,confirm_ham,"Sorry, but this just isn't the case. As much as I'd like it to be true, watching the Mystics and Seattle is truly an inferior product. I watched all 3 games of the WNBA Finals to really give it a chance, mostly because people were advocating it hard. I think it was all paid media or white knights that was driving that enthusiasm, because what I saw was not it.

They repeatedly turned the ball over in crunch time in Game 2... maybe Game 3 . The most egregious example was in the 4th Q was there were multiple 5 second inbound violations by both teams and I'm pretty sure there was an instance where both teams had 5 second violations back-to-back. The following possession, Elle Delle Donne (?) missed a wide-open bunny layup.  It was just a sloppy game to watch. If any NBA team played like this they would be crucified. Even the sloppiest NCAA March Madness game really couldn't compare to this product. Wish that wasn't the reality, and I expect the WNBA to improve, but it still has a long long way to go.",approvecomment

The world homo is generally offensive to gay people. If you don't want to be rude to gay people, don't say it. End of discussion. 


You can be edgy or offensive for laughs if you want. I certainly am, though not too often regarding homosexuality. But don't throw a fit when someone comes along and points out that it's kind of shitty (even if they can't articulate exactly why all that well).

*edit* I should add, I've known quite a few gay people throughout my life, some of them very close friends, and few of them would be particularly hurt or outraged by hearing ""no homo."" Most likely they would roll their eyes or laugh, depending on the context and who is saying it. They have some of the thickest skin of anyone I've met (not surprising, really).

So idk anymore man.",approvecomment
f1uk3r,confirm_ham,"The very connotation of ""No homo"" is that being homo is something bad or to be ashamed of that you need to specifically say you're not that. 

Imagine if someone said ""I like watermelon"" and then followed it up with ""No black person"". That'd be totally fucked up right? There's nothing wrong with liking watermelon and it's narrow minded to make a statement that specifically links it to a black person. In that same vein there's nothing wrong with admiring or praising another person of the same gender and it's narrow minded to make a statement that doing so is explicitly homosexual in nature. 

No one's stopping you from saying ""jokes"" but don't be surprised when people assume you're an asshole for telling them.

Edit: If trying to be a little empathetic and more accepting is too much for your pride you do not need to respond to this trying to justify your immature behavior to me. I'm not trying to force beliefs on anyone, rather just educate and maybe help someone see why saying ""No homo"" is considered offensive. The world is already a mean enough place.

Edit 2: Thank you reddit for repeatedly stating that homosexuality and being black are not the same thing. No kidding! I never said they were, but both the homosexual community and the black community have faced discrimination for who they are which is why I tried to use the example I did to illustrate how both types of ""joking"" are wrong. Also, there are no thought police and no one is going to prevent you from being a hateful vulgar piece of shit.

He played the 2nd most minutes as a 2nd year player in a 2nd round series against a very good knicks team. To me you are basing your opinion off even less than just the box score. Like your opinion is MJ carried them by his lonesome? That pippen was not very good? Compare that years win in the 2nd round to the loss the year before. What was different",approvecomment
Rockstar408,confirm_ham,"They won more games against the pistons in 89 than in 88. They took the pistons to 6 games in 89. Pippen had 9 steals and 8 blocks in that 6 game series. He shot 67% ts against the knicks as well. Although he did struggle offensively against the world championship pistons. No one took them past 6 that year at all. they swept the lakers in comparison.

Cj doesn’t provide the defensive versatility of Pippen, who even in his second year he was averaging 2 steals and a block a game. CJ knows that he has to show up on offense to be a positive on the outcome of the game. Pippen provided a lot to the bulls even in his rookie year. His size and court coverage were impressive. He averaged 1.2 steals and .7 blocks on just 20 minutes. 

 My argument is that MJ needed Pippen to get to the finals/wcf. So saying that Lillard is not clutch when he hasn’t been to the finals is somewhat ridiculous in my opinion. Even in his rookie season MJ was making game winners in clutch time. If his team was never good enough to get to the finals in hindsight, MJ would still be clutch as a person. Judging clutchness by finals appearance, is IMO the sign of being ignorant that titles are a team achievement, not a player achievement by and large. Like I would say Gilbert arenas was clutch, but he barely made the playoffs.",approvecomment
Rockstar408,confirm_ham,"Scottie didn’t have to be that elite to get them over the hump. They needed other defensive options to cover for their lack of a true defensive center imo.

Many black people do not differentiate between femininity and homosexuality for a guy. I've had many conversations like that.

Rockstar408,confirm_ham,"I edited my comment to give you an example of what I'm trying to explain. I don't know if you read it before replying to I'm going to copy paste it here.

> Edit: Here's an example that I hope my resonate with you. The [swastika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika) is the go to symbol of white hate groups, but when used by Hindus and Buddhists it represents love and peace. Context changes the meaning of a symbol because almost all simple symbols have versatile uses. 

> That said a symbol representing one concept does not invalidate it's representation of another concept. If a swastika is used in a town with no Hinduism or Buddhism to be found then it's pretty easy to tell they're bigots in the community.

> What you're saying is that because the ""OK"" symbol is used by people to say ""you're good to go"" it can't also mean ""white power"" when used in a certain context. Which just doesn't make sense with any bit of logic involved.

Keep in mind you moving the conversation to Hitler is avoiding the issue at hand with whataboutism and further goalpost moving but I'll try to use your example.

Hitler taking pictures with his dog is one guy. Sure he's a horribly bigot monster but he's still one person. One person doing something doesn't make it a trend.

Now lets say people in hate groups made an active effort to buy one kind of dog; lets say bulldog. They then constantly make efforts to take group pictures with their bulldogs, posting those pictures in connection to bigoted comments, mentioning their bulldogs during their sentencing for hate crimes, their clothing has patches of bulldogs on them, etc.

Well when that happens you have a clear indication that with regards to white nationalists the bulldog is a hate symbol.

This scenario doesn't mean that taking pictures with dogs is racist, or that having a bulldog is racist, it just means that if someone who you already expected possibly being a bigot is making an effort to bring up/show bulldogs then you have further reason to suspect them. 

So lets say you have that politician who constantly supports programs that negatively impact minorities and he's always rocking a bulldog tie or pin. Well, then you would want to look into his history and see if it's just a coincidence or maybe he has a history of bigotry, possibly even a connection to a hate group that's gone under the radar

But in our world a large number of bigots have never appropriated dogs or pictures with them into being a symbol of white supremacy so this isn't true. Instead we have the fact they've clearly adopted the ""OK"" symbol to be used as a signal of white supremacy. 

As such when being used by a bigot it's a hate symbol even if it wouldn't be when used by someone else. That's how context works.",approvecomment

Hate to be that guy but nearly positive she did it for the money not because she was actually afraid for her life at any point nor was she raped.  I hope she feels like shit right now tbh but she’s probably still out spending the money she essentially stole legally from him.

Girls going to hotel rooms and making out etc not expecting things to turn into sex are just outright delusional.  Be more responsible.

This is a heart-stoppingly sad.  It really reminds you that anything can happen to anyone without warning.  I've watched the Lakers my whole life, and now it just feels like watching them going forward will always be tinged with sadness.  I just can't believe that Kobe is dead.

Like any fan, I shit-talked our star player, particularly during his ""farewell tour"" last season (typing 'farewell tour' just officially made me start crying).  The last thing I ever said about him on the Internet was very unkind, even if based in facts.  I regret being so cruel now.  I'm just losing it from emotions.

In a way, this is like living through Magic's announcement of HIV again, back when that was considered a death sentence.  I remember where I was (college class), who I was with, and the utter shock and sadness of everyone around me.  I swore to appreciate life more back then, and now I'm examining once again wether I've lived up to that oath of appreciating my life.

Auto-rotation in essence is just using airflow through the blades to give them energy, since the blades are being given energy it also means the fall is retarded. On approach to the ground the pilot changes the angle of the blades to generate lift and this quickly depletes the inertial energy built up. Too soon and you run out of energy and begin falling, and land with excessive speed (crash). Too late and you don't retard your fall enough and crash. There are also a lot more conditions and failures that can prevent a successful auto-rotation.",approvecomment

howser343,confirm_ham,"You seriously think Kobe is top 15? He's not even close, look at advanced stats for a second, if you're smart enough to understand them I mean.

Let me put down my classwork for my Advanced Applications in Statistics class at MIT Open Courseware for a second to teach you a little something about how mathematical models work. You probably couldn't even begin to comprehend how the models I work on in my spare time work, but I'll try anyway. It's good to pass on the knowledge, especially to those who are not well endowed in the analytical side of things.

You must be one of those Lakers fans that thinks championships are actually important, completely ignorant to the fact that any legendary player (Duncan anyone?) would take a 55 FG% than some useless jewelry ring anyday.

You don't know anything about the PER valuations and the metrics used to accentuate intricate sample sets about autonomous principles that can be extracted to show that Kobe Bryant has never actually hit a game winner in his career. All his game winners are media hype tapes to sell shoes. Kobe is very fortunate that he's marketed so well by Nike and the Lakers franchise.

ESPN and the whole 'next Jordan' narrative has you thinking Kobe is clutch but he's not, every data point that was graphed on the Cartesian plane while prime factorization was allowed to exist in a null factor showed that Kobe continued to fail theses primitive tests. I studied statistical variations in geometric localities and each and every one of their correspondent asymptotic differentiations provided me with the conclusion that your so called Kobe is the worst clutch shooter in the NBA.

Cosine functions developed at Princeton while combined with the Bell curve allows us to measure basketball production without affecting Higgs Boson-like particles that would otherwise exist in non-zero environments. And where do you think Kobe ranks on that scale? The bottom of the Bell Curve. They ran about ten thousand trials of the same repeating polymorphic routes emulating artificially generated synergy optimization and the Mamba was nowhere to be found in either planes. ""Eye tests"" are a layman's tool for avoiding thinking and this kind of narrow tunnel vision only exacerbates current falsifications that we can rely on such a poor method of extrapolation. I don't watch basketball but the fact of the matter is that I don't need to. It's all in the stats. The numbers don't lie.

Your ""Kobe"" is just an average NBA player who gets an ungodly amount of touches thanks to his marketing. Kobe was never the best player in the league, nor even a top 250 player in the league at any point in his career. I wish people understood more the numbers side of basketball and woke up and finally realized that this guy not only is overrated, but flat out isn't good at basketball in any way whatsoever",approvecomment

MelGibsonDerp,confirm_ham,"This is classic Kyrie though... and it's the side of Kyrie that hasn't gotten any attention by the media or the fans at large. 

Kyrie doesn't just go after his teammates. He throws them under the bus when **he** has a bad game. 


[Here's part of one of my older comments:](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/e2sdk3/kyrie_has_some_choice_words_for_celtics_fans/f8xmk1x/)

***

Kyrie spent the last season trashing the people around him every time he had a bad game. r/nba needs to go back and watch those games where he was lashing out. Pretty much every single time he spoke negatively about his team was when he was the one having a bad game.

Take the Charlotte game in March. We had a 10 point lead in the fourth before Kyrie subbed in. 


* Here's Kyrie going 1/5 in the final quarter ([1](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=594&Season=2018-19&title=MISS%20Irving%2030%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&sct=plot), [2](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=625&Season=2018-19&title=Irving%202%27%20Driving%20Layup%20\(31%20PTS\)&sct=plot), [3](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=627&Season=2018-19&title=MISS%20Irving%2028%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&sct=plot), [4](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=632&Season=2018-19&title=MISS%20Irving%2026%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&sct=plot), [5](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=666&Season=2018-19&title=MISS%20Irving%2026%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&sct=plot))
* Here he is with the turnover, 0 assists for the quarter btw ([1](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=639&Season=2018-19&title=Irving%20Lost%20Ball%20Turnover%20\(P3.T11\)&sct=plot))
* Here he is just ball-watching and oblivious to where his man is ([1](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=586&Season=2018-19&title=MISS%20Walker%2010%27%20Fadeaway%20Jumper&sct=plot), [2](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=624&Season=2018-19&title=Walker%202%27%20Driving%20Layup%20\(29%20PTS\)&sct=plot))
* Here he is not making the effort to contest Kemba's shot ([1](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=576&Season=2018-19&title=MISS%20Walker%2026%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&sct=plot), [2](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=612&Season=2018-19&title=Walker%2026%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot%20\(27%20PTS\)&sct=plot))
* Here's Kyrie's fouls, mostly from playing lazy and not being in position ([1](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=600&Season=2018-19&title=Irving%20L.B.FOUL%20\(P2.T3\)%20\(M.Callahan\)&sct=plot), [2](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=634&Season=2018-19&title=Irving%20P.FOUL%20\(P3.T4\)%20\(B.Taylor\)&sct=plot), [3](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=641&Season=2018-19&title=Irving%20S.FOUL%20\(P4.PN\)%20\(M.Callahan\)&sct=plot), [4](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=657&Season=2018-19&title=Irving%20P.FOUL%20\(P5.PN\)%20\(B.Taylor\)&sct=plot))


And that's all in just the 4th quarter...


Guess what he had to say to the media afterward:

> “The game was over in the beginning of the fourth quarter,” Irving told reporters. “We took our foot off the gas pedal; it got to a five-point game, momentum shifted from there.”
> 
> He was then asked what does the team talk about following a game like this, one in which the Celtics had an 18-point lead in the fourth quarter only to allow the Hornets to close out the game with a 30-5 run. 
> 
> “Being more mature down the stretch,” Irving said. 
> 
> ...
> 
> “Judge us when we have our full lineup,” Irving said. “But obviously when we come out and play like this with a bunch of young guys down the stretch, figuring things out … things are bound to happen but there’s no excuses.”

***

This isn't about Jarrett Allen at all. 

This is about Kyrie looking for a scapegoat after he went 6/21 (14 points) and had a -29 (worse than all teammates combined) for the night.

No one thinks it's a perfect shield. But it's essentially a ""if you can help yourself and possibly prevent yourself from coming down with the flu,"" then why not get the vaccine. There's very rarely a serious reaction to the vaccine unless you have an egg allergy, but I don't even think this an issue anymore in the inactivated flu vaccine over the live attenuated.

People shouldn't look at the flu vaccine as a 'damned if you do, damned if you don't"" option. The researchers who develop the vaccine rely heavily on epidemiological data and attempt to 'beat the flu' to the punch, so that by time the virus has spread to the US, in this case, people have received the vaccine and developed a strong immunity to it.

But as you've pointed out, the flu can mutate/undergo antigenic shift so that the annual strain is different year in, year out. It's not a perfect solution.

IamOlderthanMe,remove,"I don't get why people think guy is some lowkey douche. I remember watching a player tribune video and guy seemed like a very well-spoken and geniune dude. Maybe he has faults and could seem immature but it doesn't seem he is some POS person. It's why I laugh at the arrogant Jimmy Butler fanboys thinking KAT is not some good hearted person. I really feel bad for his loss man.

I'm done with people being entitled in America. It's not just about taking things seriosuly but just understnading the situation. Many people complain about how much these lockdowns are hurting many people and I aree. We can't expect to lockdown America for so long, but we need to get people hve already and can be affected by this and it's not good. It's why I wish people just stopped panicking like the babies in r/coronovirus making everything seemed like the end of the world and people at /unpopularopinion saying this virus is a joke and that everything should cater ot people who won't bve affected and going to malllies and getting dollies for my baby girl is more important. 
  That's to any conservativesliving in POS joke states like Alabmama, Florida, Texas, and whatever white KK hotspots GO FUCK YOURSELF. This applies to you baby insecure SJWs living in California. If oyu don't like republicnas or democrats just don't ever go these states or care about them. I'm never going to shitty states that have KKK activity like georgia or North Carolina cause I know there will be some sort of racism so I don't give a fuck.

 I don't care if KAT is a celebrity, his mother fuckin died and seemed like a average American. Fuck America at times. Hope people just take things seriosuly and just look towards getting things done SOON. We could possibly get this under control, we should always have faith. The season can literally restart in 2020. But just do THINGS NOW. Americans are super entitled and the reason why KAT mothers died is because AMerica will never be united. America's culture is like a thrid world country tbh. It's honestly sad. Feel bad for good Americans like me but many want to play poltiics.",removecomment

wade took 15% more shots and got 150% more FTA, bosh took 1% more shots and shot 140% more FTA

lebron's FTA were 2/4/4/4/2/4

his FGA were 16/15/14/11/19/15

he took half his shots inside 10' and actually got most of his FTA on shots OUTSIDE 10' which is fucking weird and has probably never happened to him since

#chalmers got 3 more FTA on half as many shots and he only took 9 shots inside 10'

but someone had to pay the price for the mavs getting fucked in 2006 and who better than the league's newly crowned supervillain

on the other end, lebron got called for 20 fouls, the most on the heat and the 2nd most overall (chandler 24)

it was just a weird series and the only thing he could have done was make bombs. up until that point of his career, he was 31/190 for 16% on deep 3s

after that point he's 85/258 for 33% on deep 3s and that's above the league average (the last 4 years he's become ELITE at long 3s, going 69/179 for 39% which is at the top of the NBA)

he evolved to prevent that scenario from happening again. elite players evolve or they don't stay elite for long.",removecomment

So without further ado, here are my reasons Garpax need to go:

In no particular order

* Cristiano Felicio Contract. He was 25 years old averaging 4 and 4.
* Waiving Spencer Dinwiddie in favor of Michael Carter-Williams
* Trading Tony Snell for Michael Carter-Williams
* Letting Spencer Dinwiddie walk in favor of MCW
* John Paxson choking Vinny Del Negro (His own hire), he would later be quoted ""What also disappointed me was that VDN never owned up to making a mistake""
* Fired Scott Skiles on Christmas Eve
* Fired Bill Cartwright days after Thanksgiving after giving him mismatched rosters and under-preforming
* Overruling This lobbying for Draymond Green to draft Marquis Teague
* Refused or failed to take back salary and gather assets preferring to bet on player Development in Jabari Parker & Otto Porter JR
* Tyrus Tomas for LaMarcus Aldridge
* The biggest free agent signing of their tenure they almost immediately started drama with telling him he was no longer allowed to wear a headband. This policy would appear to be reverted years later w/ no explanation
* Interviewed no one for the job of Head Coach but Jim Boylen & hired him. Worse several reporters (For example Vinny Goodwill) have alleged that this was like to have been planned since the summer beforehand.
* Blindsided Hoiberg by firing him after showing up expecting to run practice. During his tenure here they fed him a steady stream of their personal projects & mandated them to receive playing time. None of these projects worked out. Examples are Jerian Grant, Cameron Payne, Joffrey Lavergne, Zipser, Felicio, etc.
* Leaked that Derrick Rose was healthy to the media putting a ton of pressure on him to return in time for the playoffs & launching a wave of jokes that never really let up
* Let Ron Adams go from Thibs Staff angering him & resulting in him going on to be the architect of the Warriors championship defense. He now has 3 rings.
* Not trading Pau Gasol in 2015-16 where we would miss the playoffs and he would walk for nothing
* Ran such a sloppy situation around Thibs firing that word reached Thibodeau Hoiberg would be his likely replacement while he was still coaching the team. Also serious speculation that this was told to players, undermining his authority as coach.
* Thibs even being hired is a win for them right? No, they actually didn't want him. Tom Thibodeau was the recommendation of an outside group hired by Reinsdorf. John Paxson wanted Doug Collins and Gar Forman wanted Mike Brown.
* Refused to hire Thibs strength & conditioning coach (Anthony Falsone) in Houston. He would later be hired and win the championship with the San Antonio Spurs in 2013-14. He still serves as their athletic director today.
* Escorted Thibs out with security when he was fired.
* Overpaid Fred Hoiberg 5 years /25 million and then fired him before it was complete. K.C. Johnson has speculated this is the reason why Jim Boylen remains. As, they don’t want to be paying two coaches not coaching at the same time.
* Letting a lot of talent walk for nothing. To avoid the headache of having to defend each and every player in this group I’ll make my case for the best and attach the rest as honorable mentions. Omer Asik is the biggest mistake. We had no backup 5 to replace him and Houston ended up getting an almost lottery pick for him later on so he was definitely moveable if we ever wanted out. Honorable mentions: Deng, Marco, E’Twaun, the Bench mob.
* Amnestied Carlos Boozer way too late to be able to matter
* Leaked that Kris Dunn apparently wasn’t working hard enough over the summer
* Failed to see the writing on the wall and instead of rebuilding committed us to that meaningless three alphas year just to do the same thing in the end.
* The entire Doug McDermott situation can be made into like eight bullets and is stupidly controversial among Bulls fans. But I know there will be stans in the comments so I will let them defend Garpax.
* Trading 17 & 18 for 11 in the 2013 draft

\*Using #11 to draft Doug Mcderrmott in a good draft.

* Dumping Doug Mcderrmott just two years later for basically nothing.
* Were incredibly late to the game of analytics, frequently downplaying its importance.
* Kevin O’ Connor speculates that their promising to draft Chandler Hutchison restricted us from doing any draft night trades involving the #22 pick in 2018. Started our rebuild by selling a second- round pick. (We know Jordan Bell isn’t good, that’s never what this was about)
* Third largest market in the NBA, paid the luxury tax twice. Traded for OPJ whose making 27 million and has played in 24/78 games available. If his girlfriend is reliable he’s also not a fan of the front office and a free agent in a year.
* Horrible medical team. We’re always injured every single year.
* Rosters frequently have big holes and they take bizarre steps to fix them. No Small Forward? Jabari. Need a long-term scoring option next to Rose? 33-year-old Rip Hamilton seems like a safe bet. (I love Rip but that doesn’t make it a good signing) Need a solid starting ball-handler & playmaker? Tomas Satorasnky, MCW, Jerian, Rondo seems like the wait maybe nvm. I know that you can’t nail every signing and not even all of these are bad. It’s more that there seems to be consistent gaps between how they evaluate talent & fit and that actually translates to the court.
* 5 Playoff Series wins total in a 17-year tenure.
* Had a Bulls doctor question Luol Deng about sitting out of games for a broken leg.
* Dumped John Salmons and a first & second round pick to chase Lebron and ended up with nothing.
* Trading Kirk Hinrich during his farewell tour for basically nothing.
* Again, overruling Thibs when he liked Rudy Gobert for Tony Snell
* Pulled the QO on David Nwaba for Jabari Parker. I feel like Nwaba while maybe not fantastic on his own fit really well with us. We’ve been a worse team since he left.
* Misused Lauri basically his entire time here. Maybe not directly because of this but it’s now being rumored that he wants out.
* Traded Taj Gibson in a year we made the playoffs for Cameron Payne & Joffrey Lavergne.
* Failing to net any assets at the 2020 trade deadline.
* IMO have had serious questions regarding their drafting ability since now Orlando Magic assistant GM left in 2012.
* Are alleged to use the media to trash players and coaches by [Van Gundy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I4Y4VyDqrs)

ETA: - Dwade contract

* Couldn't build around Jimmy
* Bad player development, everyone is regressing save Zach
* Had coaches spy on coaches/players (Randy Brown)
* Failed to make Chicago a FA destination
* Inherited the prestige Jordan gave us, made us a joke.
* Threatening to give Jimmy Butlers minutes to Tony Snell when he refused a contract extension.",removecomment

* Third largest market in the NBA, paid the luxury tax twice. Traded for OPJ whose making 27 million and has played in 24/78 games available. If his girlfriend is reliable he’s also not a fan of the front office and a free agent in a year.
* Horrible medical team. We’re always injured every single year.
* Rosters frequently have big holes and they take bizarre steps to fix them. No Small Forward? Jabari. Need a long-term scoring option next to Rose? 33-year-old Rip Hamilton seems like a safe bet. (I love Rip but that doesn’t make it a good signing) Need a solid starting ball-handler & playmaker? Tomas Satorasnky, MCW, Jerian, Rondo seems like the wait maybe nvm. I know that you can’t nail every signing and not even all of these are bad. It’s more that there seems to be consistent gaps between how they evaluate talent & fit and that actually translates to the court.
* 5 Playoff Series wins total in a 17-year tenure.
* Had a Bulls doctor question Luol Deng about sitting out of games for a broken leg.
* Dumped John Salmons and a first & second round pick to chase Lebron and ended up with nothing.
* Trading Kirk Hinrich during his farewell tour for basically nothing.
* Again, overruling Thibs when he liked Rudy Gobert for Tony Snell
* Pulled the QO on David Nwaba for Jabari Parker. I feel like Nwaba while maybe not fantastic on his own fit really well with us. We’ve been a worse team since he left.
* Misused Lauri basically his entire time here. Maybe not directly because of this but it’s now being rumored that he wants out.
* Traded Taj Gibson in a year we made the playoffs for Cameron Payne & Joffrey Lavergne.
* Failing to net any assets at the 2020 trade deadline.
* IMO have had serious questions regarding their drafting ability since now Orlando Magic assistant GM left in 2012.
* Are alleged to use the media to trash players and coaches by [Van Gundy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I4Y4VyDqrs)

ETA: - Dwade contract

* Couldn't build around Jimmy
* Bad player development, everyone is regressing save Zach
* Had coaches spy on coaches/players (Randy Brown)
* Failed to make Chicago a FA destination
* Inherited the prestige Jordan gave us, made us a joke.
* Threatening to give Jimmy Butlers minutes to Tony Snell when he refused a contract extension.",removecomment

#Lebron

kobe and lebron were seen in the same way back then. yeah kobe had the TEAM achievements but he had the better TEAMS and TEAMMATES

they ran those kobe/lebron puppet commercials because both of them were faces of the league.

lebron never had to pass kobe because kobe was never seen as better than lebron. i feel like a lot of folks forget that kobe spent a lot of time coming off the bench and being a role player in his early years and lebron was the best player on his team after the 1st game of his career",removecomment

Some countries chose not to act, some chose to take some weak measures (e.g. Canada), then there are countries like Taiwan. If 2-3 countries did a good job (e.g. Taiwan and Singapore), other Countries (especially the 1st world countries) have no excuse.

&nbsp;

In Chinese culture, they work to appease their boss, the yes-man culture. In the COVID-19 case, I do think the suppression started on the state level. A bunch of senior state officials got fired, not low level states people. https://www.businessinsider.com/analysis-china-hubei-officials-sacked-xi-jinping-protected-2020-2 Though this doesn't have to be the case all the time. For example, the milk powder suppression during the Beijing Olympics is on the federal level.

It does not care about politics, sex, religion, or whatever. It cares about 1 thing. The human race. And as humans, we need to come together.

Most Countries (including USA, Canada, Italy, etc), squandered time that they had to act.  Taiwan/Singapore has done a great job according to news articles.

&nbsp;

Some moot points that people brought up with respect to how other countries have responded.

1. China suppressed the Doctor that raised awareness about this. True, this was done at a state level. People have been fired for the suppression. The suppression doesn't affect the time other countries have wasted.
1. China is under reporting numbers. True, but so is every one else. The lack of testing capacity, and the virus being new affected this. We saw (in Feb) how fast this spread in China & the drastic measures they took to curb the spread but other countries just sat idle.


Unclear points against China.

1. Wave 2 numbers are unclear.

Clear points against China

1. The prevention of WHO to give information to Taiwan

This by no means is a complete list of points.

I agree with Lin, we should stop with the finger pointing. We need to take action and demand that those in office take action. We need to be proactive because simply looking for someone to blame is just a distraction, and let's be honest, a lot of it is rooted in racism.

AutoModerator,New Account Removal < 3,"There's no reason to believe that he is. Parker made a ton of money in law before starting his wine writing, he makes good money from writing, and he has all the wine that he could want, simply from having good relationships within the industry.",removecomment
AutoModerator,New Account Removal < 3,"Ostensibly, it's a matter of supply and demand. Wine is extremely influenced by terroir (microclimate and soil conditions of the growing area), and thus you can have tiny spits of lands that create amazing wine. Domainee de la Romanee-Conti is only about 5 acres in size, and its output is so regarded that bottles have a price floor of around $10K. This is compounded by the variability in weather leading to great years (vintages) and bad years. A 2009 Bordeaux will go for hundreds more than a 2008, because '08 had shitty weather. 

In reality, it's driven by marketing and hype. Oenological science (winemaking) has advanced to the point where it's hard to get a truly bad vintage. Even an '08 CdR from a good producer is really really good. I've had a 1990 Chave Hermitage and it did not justify the $400 increase in price point over a 2005. 

So then it gets driven up by perceived rarity (splitting up estates into smaller and smaller micro-vineyards), hype (marketing, placement at major restaurants), and **points**. For some UNHOLY REASON, the wine world has decided that ratings are directly equivalent to a universal, non-negotiable value of a wine. 

There's a 100pt scale, but anything good starts at 86 or so. Great wine starts at 91. Each point from Wine Advocate or Wine Spectator can justify adding another $80-100 to your MSRP. Robert Parker's word is gospel to the lawyers and dentists of the world who have more money than sense. 

In reality, Bron is falling into the trap of buying the points and not the wine. Points are given by individual reviewers, who have their own flavor profiles that appeal to them. They are far from the gospel that they are regarded as, but instead are indicators of a single person's enjoyment of a wine. If you like light, nuanced wine, throw Robert Parker out the window, because the man loves flavor bombs. If you like the mineraly, astringent whites of Alsace and Austria, toss Spectator out, because they only like sweet, creamy whites from California.

AutoModerator,Negative Karma Removal,"A guy who can't come up with a second word for ""idiocy"" shouldn't call other people names.

Anyways, there was 1.4 on clock and we were down 1. We called a time out and we decided to run the exact same inbound play we had been running the whole game. They had been leaving the short baseline open all game, and we figured they would likely pack the paint. It worked to perfection. We hit the buzzer beater and our entire team ran onto the court.

Not only did Dirk play out of his mind all playoffs, but he got revenge against the same team that broke his heart 5 years earlier in the finals and he did it by spearheading one of the greatest comebacks ever in game 2. The general consensus among nba fans was that Dirk would retire without a ring, that he was soft. It was incredible seeing him finally come through and putting all that to bed. The sad thing is he should have been in the mix more afterwards. If Cuban doesn’t split up that team the following season I think they’re repeating or at least competing. One of the biggest misconceptions about the 2011 Mavs was that it was some sort of fluke. That’s false, that team was really really good especially defensively and Tyson Chandler was the heart and soul of that defence and the perfect big to play next to Dirk. I don’t understand the decision to let him go.",removecomment

4. Steph let KD have more shots because he is a team player with no ego and knew KD's fragile ego needed to feel like he was the man.

AutoModerator,New Account Removal < 3,"Dwight was amazing OFF the ball or on the pick and roll. But he had no really offensive moves with the ball in hand. 

His foot work was mediocre at best, and his only move was this shoulder drop-then-spear that should been called for an offensive foul more often than it was. 

We actually saw that in the NBA finals when Gasol was taking the bump/charge on that move and the officials actually started calling it after Phil Jackson made a point of mentioning in a post-game interview (taking the fine for criticizing the officials). 

The issue was that Dwight simply wasn't the kind of guy who had the offensive tools to average 25+ a game, but he wanted to be in the conversation with Shaq, Hakeem, and Wilt, not Mourning and Mutumbo. So he wanted more touches, and more time in the post, and SVG woulldn't give it to him (and for good reason). 

Which soured his relationship with Orlando. 

Then Dwight didn't want to run the pick-and-roll in LA and got stuck with an offensive coach who didn't care about D. 

But even on defense, there were times when Dwight would do that volleyball spike. I felt like it was just because it looked good. He could have tipped those down and kept position instead of giving the ball back to the other team out of bounds.

Jaylen Brown has straight up come out and said Kyrie gets way too much blame for their problems last season. I’m pretty sure I trust the players who are actually in the locker room more than you.

> Kyrie is so fucking overrated by you idiots it's crazy. 

Imagine hurling insults because somebody disagrees with you about a basketball player. How old are you?

Get upset all you want, but you’re the one letting your personal feelings affect your opinion on him as a basketball player. When the players agree with me that Kyrie wasn’t the problem, and the front offices agree with me that they’d rather have Kyrie than DLo, I think it’s fair to say your opinion isn’t a very logical one.

>He joined a team that almost made the finals and they were worse the very next year. But now it's Tatum and Brown's fault.

They almost made the finals because they went up against a far inferior Cavs team. That Celtics team that made the ECF would have gotten destroyed by the Bucks all the same.

It isn’t Tatum and Brown’s “fault”. I’m just pointing out that they’re simply much better players this season compared to last. In addition, Hayward is having his best season since his all star year in Utah. You’re isolating the “Kyrie bad” narrative when in reality basketball is a team game that is affected by more than just one player. If you replace Kyrie with a PG who’s nearly as good, and every other player takes a step forward then no shit they’re going to be a better team.",removecomment

Brown has no reason to come to his defence. If he really had a problem with him he could have just as easily said absolutely nothing at all.

It isn’t just Brown either. Smart has said the same. You’re telling me all of these players are lying, and you’re the one who’s telling the truth?Come on now.

> Why do you refuse to acknowledge that Brown and Tatum took a step forward this year because Kyrie is gone? It's fairly clear that you refuse to acknowledge any narrative that involves Kyrie taking any blame for the Celtics last season.

That isn’t “clear” whatsoever.

Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are 3rd overall picks in their 3rd and 4th seasons respectively. This is exactly when they’re *supposed* to be taking a leap into star players. Their play this season is literally a natural, year to year progression that elite young prospects are supposed to go through. It isn’t anywhere near as simple as “Kyrie’s gone so they’re better”. Their play this season is the result of several seasons work in the league and the game finally slowing down for them.

> Me calling you an idiot is not ""taking this personally"" the same way I can call flat earthers idiots casually and not be emotionally invested.

Throwing personal insults because somebody disagrees with you about a basketball player is absolutely taking it personally. Especially when that person comes with facts. You’re just upset you lost an argument.

> You are the one who seems personally invested in this Kyrie adoration, not me

In what way? I have no reason to adore Kyrie. I’m just not small minded enough to let r/nba narratives affect my opinion of a player.

Let me put it simply. There isn’t a single front office in the league that would trade Kyrie for DLo should they have the chance. Not a single one. If you believe any of them would then your player evaluation skills are severely lacking.",removecomment
SmokingFrog,remove,"> You think there's absolutely no reason for former teammates to dissipate contraversy with diplomatic responses? When did you start watching sports?

He can give a diplomatic response without giving him a glowing recommendation and absolving him of all blame.

At the end of the day I'm sure the Celtics would have rather had dlo than Kyrie Irving, the Celtics would rather have an inferior kemba walker than Kyrie too.

And again, they aren’t comparable in any way. I promise you the Celtics would rather have Kyrie than DLo and Kemba. In fact they tried re-signing Kyrie even *after* all the drama. They only settled on Kemba after Kyrie chose the Nets.

> Where are your ""facts""? You provided anecdotes and opinions and absolutely no facts.

Fact: Kyrie is much better at basketball than DLo

Fact: Tatum and Brown’s progression is natural and not a cause of Kyrie being gone

Fact: Not a single front office in the league would choose DLo over Kyrie

[According to Lowe, the Boston Celtics would have offered star point guard Kyrie Irving an extension last fall “but rules capped Irving’s first-year salary in such a deal at 120% of his 2018-19 salary — well short of what he stood to make by entering unrestricted free agency.” As a result, the Celtics knew that it would be all but impossible to convince Irving to sign the extension, a scenario that’s a common happenstance in the NBA.](https://celticswire.usatoday.com/2019/07/24/report-celtics-would-have-offered-kyrie-irving-an-extension-last-fall/) 

Let me guess, Zach Lowe is lying too?

> You've provided 0 facts.  You clearly don't know what a fact even means.

SmokingFrog,remove,"> They had the opportunity to offer him an extension after the season and before free agency. They didn't.

Yeah, and as it clearly states in black and white the reason they didn’t offer a formal extension was because they were aware it wouldn’t make sense for him financially. They didn’t offer the extension because they knew it made more sense to him money-wise to wait for a bigger contract in the summer. Literally right there in English, but I understand reading comprehension isn’t really your strong suit.

In terms of this summer’s free agency, they didn’t offer him a contract because they knew he didn’t want to be there. It isn’t because they didn’t *want* him back. They just understood he’d rather be elsewhere. Not really that difficult to understand.

> Again, you don't know what ""facts"" mean. At all. This is a basic English word that you're clearly demonstrating a lack of understanding of.

I urge you to make a thread asking “would you rather have Kyrie or DLo on your team”. I promise you nobody will pick DLo. Just like no front office would pick DLo. Just like the Nets didn’t pick DLo.

AutoModerator,Negative Karma Removal,"This guy is a pure hater but i get it. It must be hard watching him raw dog your team in the playoffs. Curry is the reason Harden doesnt have a ring.. Saying he didnt change anything is false. People  were skeptical about shooting 3s because analysts like charles barkley got them believing that no jump shooting team could win a title. Curry's success winning  shooting jumpshots was a validation and it blew up. 

Lets address curry getting carried by his team mates. Tell me now that draymond would have been an all star if he played with harden, westbrook, cp3 ,lebron or any other elite player. Draymond'soffensive game relies on curry getting double teamed. Klay is a 41.9% 3pt shooter for his career. When curry leaves the floor, data has shown that percentage to drop to 38%. Have u ever seen klay get double teamed?. Klay is a great player but he still doesnt know how to split a double team till today because curry get all the attention. 2019 finals curry got double teamed, triple teamed, boxed and 1 while klay had single coverage on lowry who he just posted up all series. Warriors never lost because curry choked. They lost because nobody else stepped up. Curry averaged 30ppg in the finals. More than kwahi's 28ppg but raptors had 6 players that averaged double figures in that finals while warriors had just 3. Klay 26ppg and draymond 11ppg.. Tell me what iguodala and livingston achieved before joining the warriors. 

    Kd was known as MR Unreliable in okc because his efficiency reduced drastcally in the post season. Now he went to golden state and his efficiency skyrocketed. Kd had the most efficient years of his playoff career at golden state. Recorded his highest FG% with the warriors. Data also showed that kd became less efficient with curry off the floor. Which is why they were barely above 500 with kd and no Curry. 

Curry became an allstar and an all nba player before steve kerr got there despite being snubbed a year prior. Draymond was still a bench player when curry became an all star and klay wasnt this Klay.  Im trying to understand where your notion of getting carried by team mates came from. Steph has averaged more ppg than all those team mates except kd in every season and every playoff. And dont forget he beat kd fair and square in 2016 playoffs.. 

Lets address the elite playmaking issue. Curry was averaging 8.5assists per game under mark jackson when he was a ball dominant guard. Steve kerr convinced him to get off ball more for the team to be more unpredictable which he did. Even Doc rivers mentioned this in a press conference. Curry is selfless and doesnt play for stats which is why they always win.Can anyone tell CP3 to give up the ball? 75% of Draymond's assists are hockey assists of curry's passes and he doesnt care. Look at the 2018 houston series, games 5, 6 and 7 curry was posting 8 and 9 apg because kerr made him ball dominant when the series was about to slip away. 
 
     Lets talk about handles. Curry's handles are elite and very efficient. He used to do elaborate handles back in the days but rarely does them now because its better to driblle less while other shooters go cold.Curry and kd had identical usage in their 3yrs together. Kd never had usage close to westbrook in any season they played together. Kyrie has better handles agreed but he prefers to dribble around while shooters go cold. You have to be living under a rock not to know that kyrie's presence has never made any team better. Tatum regressed last year because of kyrie and dinwiddle is up for a down year next year when kyrie returns.. Harden doesnt have better handles than curry. Curry handles in motion while harden dribbles life out of the shot clock at one spot..

Replace harden with curry on that rockets team and i swear  they have more success.Curry makes his teammmates better than harden can ever imagine..",removecomment

But i also think the KD narrative is greatly overblown, Steph was still just as impactful in those playoffruns and I just can't fault someone for bringing in the 2nd best player in the league when you have the chance to do so.

And if you go with the Asterisk for his first then you have to start putting one to every single other title (like Lebrons the year after, because of the Green suspension).

AutoModerator,Banned Word - Drexel,"I see what you're saying. On the face of it, all of Kobe's awards look one-sided vs Hakeem's individual awards. 

Context matters, though: one year, the dream pulled a Dirk before Dirk, meaning he won with only role players. The next, his best teammate was acquired by a mid-season trade that saw the former 2nd best quit on the team (Maxwell) during the playoffs, and Drexel was then at the end of his peak years.

On the other hand, I think it matters significantly that Kobe played with prime Shaq, then had the freakishly skilful, long bois in Pau (arguably the most one-sided trade in history at the time), Bynum, and Odom.

Long story short, Hakeem did waaaay more carrying that Kobe ever had to, and that elevates him above Kobe in my admittedly biased opinion. If just looking at accolades, I think he joins Jordan and Kawhi as the first to win MVP, FMVP, and DPOY the same year. And one year he should have won over Robinson, was robbed, then took it very personally in their playoff match up. People forget he's top 10 in steals and number one in blocks, so arguably the most unique and versatile defender the game has seen as well.

That's my case, but it's a debate.",removecomment

Rockstar408,remove,"First, I remember healthcare prior to Obama. You're right that healthcare has been free market in America for a long time. But never before has it been so closely tied to employment where almost all large employers are forced to provide healthcare for full time employees. It fucked up a lot of people's lives and is part of why so many people have to have two jobs now.

At a place I managed we used to have full time hourly employees just out of high school. But with Obamacare we cut all their hours to less than 28 per week to avoid having to provide healthcare for them. 

Any full time employees and their employers immediately starting paying premiums for ALL employees. This immediately added billions of dollars in premiums to the corporations controlling health insurance.

It also forced many companies to cut hours so much that people who were making a living before were completely screwed.

And a healthy person used to be able to choose rather they wanted to pay out of pocket for a yearly checkup or pay for insurance. It's cheaper to just pay out of pocket for one yearly visit if you are lucky enough to stay healthy. 

Health insurance is supposed to be used for risk mitigation. If you're low risk then why should you be forced to pay exorbitant premiums??? 

Plus, those premiums are not on a case by case basis. If they were healthy young 20 year old would pay very little in insurance costs. As it is young employees on a company provided healthcare plan pay the same as a 40 year old or 50 year old employee, meaning they're paying for some of the burden and risk of the older employees with no choice to drop out.

Not to mention how many services aren't covered by insurance plans and how insane your deductibles can be. On many you have to pay 5k out of pocket for hospital services before anything is even covered by the plan you pay for, and thats assuming you are in the right network and seen by the right doctors and the procedures are ultimately deemed necessary and are covered by the insurance company and plan you have.

Second, your second paragraph agrees with what I said. 

But I think our healthcare costs are artificially propped up partially because there is no mediator. The government providing healthcare would allow them to leverage mass purchasing of supplies and medicine and also control market costs of critical medical supplies.

This extrapolates the previous problem even further because so many people were forced into paying for health insurance in the new system and with the costs being outrageously high it multiplies the profit margins of those corporations.

This is asinine.",removecomment

Lastly, assists are only counted if the player makes the shot. Using that as a metric without looking at how bad everyone else played is also nonsense. Go back and watch how many open shots were whiffed by Barnes, Iggy, and Thompson. 

Everyone played down. Curry wasn't great, but saying he massively choked is a straight up delusional argument. You're looking for some kind of legitimate excuse to hate on him when the truth is there isn't really. This is painfully obvious by the fact your initial reasoning for hating on Curry is that he threw his mouthpiece. If you want to hate, go ahead. But don't act like your reasons come from anything based in reality.",removecomment
SmokingFrog,remove,"He was the first unanimous mvp who continued his stellar play until that finals series, he averaged more turnovers than assists as the PG and scored much less than what he was showing in every other part of that season, hows that disingenuous? Name another season or series he had more turnovers than assists

A high turnover player? What stats do you have to back that up lol, he averaged 4.3 TO per game, which is more than any season he’s had. We both saw that behind the back pass into the stands in a crucial moment of game 7

I don’t think it’s delusional at all, he went from 30.1/5.4/6.7 on 50/45/91 with 3.3 TO per game to 22.6/4.9/3.7 40/40/93 with 4.3 TO per game , that’s a huge drop off for a unanimous mvp. 

Stats don’t even do it justice, it looked clear when he lost his cool and threw his mouthpiece at a fan. It’s not hate haha, I like him but I’m not blindly defending him like yourself",removecomment
SmokingFrog,remove,"Dude, if you think players normally equal their stats from regular season to finals you know jack shit about basketball. The more you talk, the more apparent this becomes. He averaged 1 more turnover than he normally did. I can't believe this is your basis and you genuinely believe this is worthy of discussion. 

You wonder why Curry gets a pass for 2016 and LeBron doesn't for 2011? It's because they aren't even close to comparable. And me continuing to indulge this argument is beyond a waste of time. Hope you learn how basketball works some day.",removecomment

1/28 CDC states “ While CDC considers covid a serious situation and is taking preparedness measures, the immediate risk in the US is considered low.” 

1/29 White House announces Coronavirus Task Force created. Note - this is despite the WHO downplaying the threat! 

1/31 Trump bans travel from China. Media and multiple Democrats slam his decision calling it racist/xenophobic. 2/5 Trump acquitted (impeachment). 

2/5 Chuck Schumer in a tweet continues to call Trumps’ travel ban from China “premature.” 

2/7 White House’s Coronavirus Task Force gives press briefing. 

2/9 White House Coronavirus Task Force meets with all governors regarding virus. 

2/12 CDC waiting for approval from Chinese for CDC team to travel to China. 

2/18 HHS announces partnership to develop vaccine. 

2/21 Italy identifies its very first case in their country. 

2/21 CDC tweets that it is working with States for preparedness. 

2/24 Trump sent letter to Congress asking for $25B for virus effort. 

2/24 Nancy Pelosi made a stop in Chinatown and encouraged people to “please come and visit and enjoy Chinatown.” 

2/25 there is still no reported community spread in the US!!! (Per CDC tweet.) 

2/27 first community transmission in US. 

2/27 Trump appoints Pence to coordinate efforts.

Were the American citizens who wanted Bin Laden dead after 9/11 just as bad or worse as Bin Laden? I can kind of see it as like a situational thing maybe, like ‘Well they have similar indifference about the sanctity of life that could lead them to make the same decisions if the circumstances were flipped.’ I don’t know tho, it’s hard for me to wrap my head around the ethical reasoning you use to come to that conclusion, and I’m totally open to hearing and trying to better understand that line of thinking if you’re willing to explain a bit",removecomment

IamOlderthanMe,remove,"Birmingham is something like the 43rd biggest TV market in the country, and was the most consistent football TV market (i.e. highest rated) for 16 years in a row. It's a bigger media market than either Memphis or New Orleans, according to Nielsen.

Obviously there's no way to know if that would translate to NBA fandom. But again, there are no major pro sports teams in the market. So there wouldn't be any competition for eyeballs, once football is over.

As for metro size: https://moving.selfstorage.com/largest-metro-areas-without-major-league-sports-teams/

Top 10 isn't bad. Plus it's pretty clear Birmingham is the most sports-obsessed of any of that top 10.

I'm not saying it's a no brainer or anything. Obviously Seattle is the best candidate because the team is already wanted there. But Birmingham is a strong candidate for that second spot just because of the lack of competition by other non-football teams.",removecomment

im not sure how ANYBODY could watch trae and steph play and think it is appropriate to compare their 3pt percentages directly. it's utterly useless. 

disclaimer: i think that steph curry is the best shooter in nba history. that is not up for debate. steph's pull-up 3pt% is higher than trae's, and his 3pt% off of passes is higher than trae's. but *far* too many people directly compare his 3pt% to players like james harden and trae young which makes the gap seem bigger than it is.",removecomment

AutoModerator,Negative Karma Removal," With the Pacers leading 97–82 and less than a minute left in the game, Pistons [center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(basketball)) [Ben Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Wallace) attempted a layup shot but was fouled hard from behind by Pacers SF Ron Artest, now known as [Metta World Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metta_World_Peace). A furious Wallace then shoved Artest, and the benches emptied; a fight broke out on the court between players of both teams. After the fight was broken up, a fan threw a drink from the stands at Artest while he was lying on the scorer's table to cool himself down. Artest immediately charged after the fan, sparking a massive brawl between players and spectators that stretched from the seats down to the court and lasted several minutes.

AutoModerator,New Account Removal < 3,"Harden is a waaaaaaaaaay better offensive player, DWade had moves but he was a very limited shooter, got the line, but had a bad FT shooting for a guard. 

Harden is also very underrated defensively. Nevertheless, Wade is better defensively overall and on his prime he was DPOY-level in 08/09 after Beijing, but the most important thing is that he is much more consistent overall. 

So until consistency matters it’s even, when it matters throughout tough playoff series when you can’t fall below your level on every single night, it’s advantage to DWade which is crucial.",removecomment

If I was able to change history, I'd say James Harden didn't deserve his and Giannis's MVP coming up would also go to LeBron.

Others disagree because it's TRUE, Harden had 15 more wins, but his stats were worse and he clearly had better help, along with a very strong narrative of being ""ROBBED"" twice. Everyone was on his dick in 2018.

And Giannis ALSO deserves MVP, his season is comparable to 2013 LeBron and 2016 Curry, but I'd still choose LeBron because I feel like he's still better and has a bigger impact.

And occasionally, such as in Talking With Strangers, says rather... atrocious things. Specifically, when he talks about the relationship between alcohol and rape. It is a very, very uncomfortable read. In the book ""Blink"" he basically espouses mind reading in various parts. 

He's a very bright guy, but he loves to play to the new age-y nonsense crowd. He has some legitimate ideas, and he does a good job popularizing a number of social science ideas, it's just interlaced with bullshit. Which makes it kind of super frustrating.

So yeah, you didn't get the wrong impression of him. He's just got a lot of problems, and shouldn't really be taken at face value. He LOVES to speak about things as known or concrete even when the evidence is flimsy at best. 

But again, he also popularizes a lot of things, and gets people interested in social science stuff to begin with, which has its benefits. So yeah. He's no the devil or anything, he's just not really a real source for knowledge. If you read anything he writes, use it as a place to start digging deeper, double check any claim he makes, etc.

But most of them wouldn’t have pushed a fake more than an athlete brand beforehand, and thus wouldn’t be in this same position

There’s a reason no one is criticizing the other star players as much as Lebron for the China stuff. Because none of them were profiting off more than athlete merch and doing interviews about how they won’t shut up and dribble, and then turn around and tell Morey to shut up and dribble

> Maybe expect less from Celebrities? Don't believe ads?

Again you’re missing the point. It’s not about people expecting these players to speak out about China. They didn’t. Most of the comments at the time were saying “I wouldn’t speak out either”.

Simply transposing later success onto an earlier rendition is asinine as Ceballos was not a made man, and had yet to break out. By all accounts Dumas was every bit the starting SF, putting up nearly 16ppg, 4.3 Reb 1.3stl 1.0blk per game, sandwiching a couple of 17pt games with a monster 20pt 12reb 5ast 2stl 3blk gm-1, and 25-5 in gm-5.

[Al Gore said that about](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryAnecdotes/comments/6j1mlx/al_gores_perfect_butter_story/) Bill Bradley when Bradley had just joined the Senate

> At a party for New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley in 1987, Tennessee Senator Albert Gore included a fanciful tale about the former basketball star in a speech he gave in his honor. Soon after Bradley entered the Senate, said Gore, he was invited to make a speech at a banquet and sat proudly at the head table waiting for his turn to speak.

> When the waiter came over at one point and put a pat of butter on his plate, Bradley stopped him. “Excuse me,” he said, “can I have two pats of butter?”

> ”Sorry,” said the waiter, “one pat for a person.”

> ”I don’t think you know who I am,” said Bradley. “I’m BILL BRADLEY, the Rhodes Scholar, professional basketball player, world champion, United States Senator.”

> ”Well, maybe you don’t know who I am,” retorted the waiter.

> ”Well, as a matter of fact, I don’t,” admitted Bradley. “Who are you?”

> ”I’m the guy,” said the waiter, “who’s in charge of the butter!”

AutoModerator,Banned Word - rape,"Or, alternatively, Kobe destroyed all good will with Shaq by dragging his name through the mud during Kobe's rape scandal, and destroyed what could have been the greatest franchise of all time because he made it clear he would leave for the Clippers if they didn't let Shaq go.  Kobe ran one of the best players in league history out of town because he couldn't handle being second banana and because he was a nightmare of a human being.  Its all in the story you want to tell.   The Kobe deification on this sub is absolutely insane.  If you're judging toxic locker room behavior, its pretty hard to beat accusing your teammate of squashing sexual assault allegations with payouts in a legal deposition.

And the idea the 2013 Knicks could have won anything is ludicrous.   Melo dragged that team into the second round by force of will alone.   His teammates were Iman Shumpert, JR Smith, Raymond Felton, a 80 year old Marcus Camby, Tyson Chandler on half a leg, and exactly zero useful NBA players other than that.  The fact they were even in that Pacers series shows how amazing Carmelo was at his peak, that team was fucking garbage.

Canada’s is an ongoing thing until this is over. Trump hasn’t announced any additional founds to Americans that have lost their job at this point. 

> Some people just don't know when to suck up their feelings and say ""great job"", even when it's someone they dislike.

It was announced earlier that the trump administration didn’t even order additional respirators or masks until mid-late March. Yeah they did a great job there. 

> I'm convinced half the Trump haters in the USA would be angry if he cured cancer for fucks sake. ""But... Why didn't he do it sooner?!? BLOOD ON HIS HANDS"".

I’m actually not a Trump hater. I don’t care for him but I would have voted him last election, and again this upcoming election if I was an American. At the same time he has done an outstandingly awful job at this time, and comparing his plan to other countries he actually caused the most harm to its citizens. 

> I expect you won't be cashing your 1200$ check since you hate the President so much and he's done 'nothing' to help anyone.

And I won’t because I’m not an American and actually still have my job, I just work from home now. So I have complete job/financial security throughout this epidemic.

You can argue that kd killed curry's dominance and didnt help him. Kd was the beneficiary of curry's dominance. Kd never had a signature playoff series till he went to the warriors. Okc called him Mr unreliable because his numbers dropped in the playoffs. In golden state he became an afterthought because teams were worried about allowing curry to get hot.. Klay haas shot 41.9% 3pt for his career. Without curry, that 3pt % drops to 38%. We all saw draymomd's true value this season. Draymond is only a beneficiary of curry. Put draymond on a team with westbrook and im sure he wont even be in the starting line up in 2 yrs.. Curry is a great shooter from 3pt, midrange, finishing around the rim and the best FT shooter in nba history..Curry finishes around the rim more efficiently than kyrie. Kyrie may be flashy but curry is more efficient..He makes his team mates better. Half of the players he took to the finals last year arent even in the nba anymore..

Hope you understand that curry became an all star and all nba player under mark jackson. Before steve kerr became their coach. Draymond wasnt even a starter then.

He's mocking the original top comment by saying things like ""their's such a big disconnect between myself and your typical redditor"" - because that's what the original top commenter is essentially doing: creating a disconnect between himself and those ""ITT who have have never hooped""

It's a caricature of *that guy who peaked in high school and always brings up that one big game to try and impress people years later*.

No one is being given the nickname ""speedhawk"" lmao.  And when he says *why* his coaches called him that, it's because he had ""such a nose for basketball"", which has nothing to do with speed.

MJ loses 2017-2018. If we just insert MJ's stats for LeBron's he easily wins 2016 finals against an injured Warriors team. He might even win 2015 finals as well when you look at LeBron's inefficiency (47% TS) compared to 60%+ that MJ always had. The 2014 is a tossup. We all know 2013 was completely luck based and LeBron didn't play well at all until game 7 and average in game 4/6, so MJ gets this as well. 2012 MJ gets it. 2011 I would probably say yes. 2007 was a horrible finals by LeBron - 22  pts 42% TS - and they had 2 close games. So at the very least MJ takes that series to 6.

SmokingFrog,remove,"Oh my god, this is getting embarassing for you.

> He literally used Stockton and Curry as the examples and gave examples of how different models would effect the outcomes, and it works perfect opposite of how you think it does. The literal calculation has Stockton far and away better and its only after applying the statistical model that gives greater weight to higher achieving individual seasons that Curry jumps up the rankings.

You do realize that this is with a new model that weights longevity even more heavily at it's base right (even before the corrections to the curve)... 

You do realize that the guy who made these models himself does not use that one for his top 40 list, precisely because it's even less accurate than the original model right...

Why do you think Curry is ranked higher than Stockton in his top 40, that was updated in 2019, despite him exploring this new (innacurate) model in 2018? C'mon kid, use your head for once.

> In other words, exactly what I said at the start of the conversation and exactly opposite of what you claimed it did.

Except it's not. You're confusing the experimental model's data with the original model's (which is what I made used to back up my claims), you fucking buffoon.

How do you get so confused so often? That's been a consistent theme for you in this thread. Looooooooooooooooool.

> still have yet to read the article.

You do see the irony in this right?

> We both know you didn't actually read that shit

Funny, since you clearly didn't read my comments.

What's defensible about: 

> West still had the ball in his hands more than Goodrich, especially during the prime of West's career when he played like 40 minutes a game. Goodrich didn't handle the ball as much as West until the 70 season when he returned to the Lakers

You still don't understand that having the ball in your hands doesn't make you a point guard. 

Maybe that's why you turned tail and ran away from this:

*More ignorance. Being a score first guard doesn't preclude you from being a point guard, and handling the ball more/averaging more assists than a PG doesn't imply that you're a PG.*

*LeBron handles the ball (and averages more assists) than many point guards. Larry Bird did too. They were both better pure passers than the majoirty of PGs, and yet they are considered small forwards. Harden and Jokic handle the ball a ton and also average more assists than most PGs. Should we consider them PGs instead of SG and C then? Of course not.*

*For more than half of West's career, he played alongside Gail Goodrich. They were both combo guards and could play both positions, so that's where the confusion comes from. Some people say West was the PG and Goodrich was the SG, but most (in my experience) have West as the SG. There's a reason you see Jerry West on all-time SG rankings more often than you do on PG rankings.*

*For example, ESPN has him on their all-time [SG rankings](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/nbarankSGs/ranking-top-10-shooting-guards-ever), and not on their all-time [PG rankings](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/nbarankPGs/ranking-top-10-point-guards-ever)*

You thought being a score first player has anything to do with whether you are a point guard or not. Wrong.

You thought if a player averages more assists than a point guard then he must also be a point guard. Wrong.

You keep zero-ing on whether West was an SG or PG, which is irrelevant to this discussion as Curry had both a better peak and better resume. And I've already said that it's subjective but that way more people have him as an SG for a reason.

On this sub, and on /r/ nbadiscussion ([example here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cj5gtp/who_are_your_top_5_shooting_guards_of_alltime/)), way more people consider him to be an SG than a PG. ESPN didn't have him on the PG list, neither did Bleacher Report. But again, it's irrelevant in regards to whether Stockton is better than Curry, or in regards to whether Curry had a higher peak and better resume.

> You also said Curry was better than West regardless of position, which is actually insane.

No, it's really not. I said he had a better peak and resume, and since I value those highly I would have him over West. And clearly many people agree. 

*Turns out Bleacher Report's [rankings from 2019](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2852716-nba-all-time-player-rankings-top-10-point-guards#slide9) also don't consider West a PG. They also have Curry above Stockton, and at #2 overall.*

*In fact, the majority of rankings I've found online that were made recently (after Curry's MVPs and championships and numerous elite seasons) have Curry above Stockton. Quite a few have him in the #2 spot as well.*

*This writer for [nba.com](https://www.nba.com/magic/news/ranking-point-guards-history-3-20180126) does have West as a PG, which is a point for you, but they also have Curry in the #2 spot (easily above Stockton).*

*I checked out what the folks over at /r/ nbadiscussion think, and the [majority over there](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ax2s4w/steph_currys_all_time_point_guard_ranking/) seem to have Curry as the #2 PG of all-time as well.*

And let's not forget how you just straight up lied to inflate Stockton's impact:

*This is wrong. First of all, Magic literally had a better assist per game rate over his career. And even if you were talking about best assist per game rate over a single season, then that's still a ""dishonest stat"" as there are multiple players who would have had better assist per game rates than Stockton if they were on those Jazz teams. Stockton is practically the only PG to play his entire starting career alongside one of the best ten scorers in NBA history.*

*And if your comment was referring to best per game rates in a single season, then when it comes to defensive stats you would be even more wrong. There have been multiple players who have exceeded Stockton's career high in defensive stats in a single season (and multiple players who have better per game defensive stats for their career).*

*So whether you meant that no player has matched Stockton's per game assist and defensive stat rates in his peak seasons or over his career, that's a straight up lie. For both steals and assists there are players who have exceeded Stockton's career per game rates, and quite a few players who have exceeded his season-high defensive stat rates. There is so much wrong in your comment I have to wonder if you're on drugs today.*

widesheep,remove,"I mean, there’s definitely been other bad presidents. I don’t like Trump, but he’s not any worse than the others, he’s just worse at not getting caught. Anyone who works their way to that position is covering some very, VERY sketchy things. He’s just the worst at hiding them. Everyone who has a firm belief in a politician has to overlook things. It’s a matter of what things someone can overlook. Some people can overlook the racism because it lines their pockets. Some people were able to overlook Obama jailing whistle blowers because it furthered their agenda, and people were able to overlook Bush’s non-reaction then subsequent over reaction to 9/11, Clinton getting a hummer, Regan selling weapons against Congress’ wishes and so on, because it furthers their plots. My point is they’re all terrible. Not one single politician is out to help the people. The ones who say they are, are not. If they were, they would be doing something positive with their time and their life instead of driving a wedge into society over partisan politics.  They’re out to make a buck, like we all are. The problem is their dollar comes at the expense of roughly half the people they represent.",removecomment

I don’t give a fuck if a large amount of people on the other side believe it either. Just means there’s that many idiots and/or assholes. This isn’t about saying liberalism is definitively better than conservatism as a political philosophy, it’s about Donald Trump being an obvious and easily identifiable corrupt/selfish piece of shit as a human. Those who can’t look past their own political ideology to see a clear-cut example of a human parasite are never going to have their opinions validated just because “everyone has an opinion”.",removecomment

We will never see a player like Garnett ever again.

No 5 footers in the last All Star game. 

Isaiah Thomas the hero of manlets has already been kicked out of the NBA for being shit.

> Jokic is one of the best passers in the league, leads the league in game winners, and is already the best passing center of all time.

There are 3 billion 5 footers in the world and you are going to tell me that not a single one of them is better than that bum?

Very easy to pass the ball when you see everyone from above and it's hard as fuck to block you because you are 7 foot tall.

>  Thon Maker is a good example. He is athletic and is said to have a great work ethic by everyone, but he's mediocre.

Quick Google search: ""When he was 14, Maker was discovered by Edward Smith... 

At first, Maker was reluctant to leave the soccer field behind to focus on organized basketball... At that time Thon was spending his time playing soccer, and had never played basketball a day in his life.""

""I said no, not because of him, but just I didn’t want to play basketball,"" Maker explained. ""But after trusting in him and going along with the plan, he said, 'Trust me, trust me.'""

 Another case of a Soccer reject being told to pursue a Basketball career because Basketball is easy money for very tall dudes... Holy shit there are many many cases of lazy very tall people choosing Basketball for easy money.

Thon Maker is a lazy dude, he couldn't make it in soccer, a sport where you can make a decent living in thousands of teams (each team has like 22 players)... Yet, he quit and switched to Basketball at the age of 14 and is earning millions in the NBA already even if he doesn't give a fuck about the sport.

> The reason the other antetokounmpo brothers have contracts is so teams can lure in Giannis.

The NBA is the dumbest shit ever haha.

> By the way, Giannis is known for having a crazy work ethic lol.

A European Soccer reject has crazy work ethic... Holy shit, if you think a bum like him has work ethic then that explains why the US sucks at European sports like Rugby and Soccer. You have no idea what work ethic means mate.

> you also need to understand that even soccer players require a lot of natural talent. Every single sport requires natural talent and athleticism to compete at the top. Messi is insanely quick and coordinated. Ronaldo is one of the most athletic guys on the planet. Basketball isn't much different.

That's insulting, you will never see rejects form other sports making it to the top of Soccer, let alone reject from other sports that were developed by countries with no soccer infrastructure.

Messi and Ronaldo started to play Soccer at age 4 and worked their assess off, they left their families behind at the age of 11 to go the Barcelona academy (Messi) and Sporting Lisbon (Ronaldo), that's work ethic... They are at the top because of hard work, Messi and Ronaldo are not gifted athletes, Messi looks like a retard and Ronaldo looked like this at the age of 18 [before and after](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/huUuBVRPTKk/maxresdefault.jpg)

AutoModerator,New Account Removal < 3,"1) Basketball is inherently a star-driven sport. 5 guys on the court, 1 player can have a significant enough impact to win the game himself, usually by scoring a lot. 22 players on a football field, and look at who are the most popular, QB’s/WR’s/RB’s, the guys that do the scoring.

2) Football players wear helmets covering their face. Basketball players have their faces shown all the time.

3) Basketball is an international sport, basically just a numbers game at that point in terms of followers. I would reckon that soccer players have more IG followers than American football too.",removecomment

The Spurs barely escaped a 7 game series with the Suns after some controversial suspensions and then swept the Cavs in a series where it never really felt like the Cavs had a chance.

Jalen Smith, lean and mobile 6’10  3 and D big that can also rebound. Really fits today’s game. Honestly don’t know why he’s so low, might be because this is his second year? Don’t see what’s wrong with him besides maybe lacking star upside.

McDaniels tho I’m not a fan of and I usually love the tall skinny wings. I just don’t think he plays smart basketball at all, and it negates what skill he does he have. To play the type of way he perceives himself, he either has to get a lot more skilled or a lot smarter and I don’t think either happens.

AutoModerator,Banned Word - Holyfield,"To act like Roy wouldn't put up a fight is absolutely ridiculous. Roy embarassed the light heavyweight division so bad that he had to move up to heavyweight and then dominated the heavyweight champ at the time, who had beaten Evander Holyfield before that.

I think Tyson would've won with both in their primes, simply because you can't make up 40 pounds in the ring like that and Roy was a super middleweight originally for Christ's sake, but to act like he wouldn't be able to do anything is pure fantasy, Roy went years without losing ROUNDS.

In 2003, it's not even a debate, you clearly don't know or ignore how bad Tyson looked against Lennox Lewis and how awful he was at this point of his career compared to his former self, so awful that he got knocked out by Danny fucking Williams.",removecomment

People excuse it by saying he didn’t take the Douglas fight seriously and that if he didn’t go to prison he would have beaten Holyfield, but that’s all speculation. A lot of Ali’s biggest fights happened after his boxing license was taken away from him during his prime. By then he’d notably lost a lot of the movement and speed that he had in his prime, but he still managed to beat all the heavyweights of his era. I’m not saying Tyson wasn’t a great fighter, but to me it feels like people overrate him because of the mysticism that surrounded him. Especially Americans.",removecomment

SmokingFrog,remove,"FYI Chetniks are shit heads- they were Serbian nationalists who collaborated with the Nazi occupiers during World War 2. They spent as much time murdering Muslim civilians as they did Croatian resistance fighters.

After the war, they were either liquidated by the Soviets or tried and shot by Yugoslav courts. This new political party was founded after the fall of communism by war criminal Slobodan Milosevic.",removecomment

Personally I hate the lack of a headphone jack. They did a great job with the airpods but they would still work just as well on a phone with a headphone jack. People that don't want to charge headphones, pay extra, or audiophiles still prefer wired headphones. Now they can't even plug same headphones into laptop or phone without adapters.

While I'm glad I don't have to deal with all the adapters I love what they are doing with the laptop ports. USB-C can do everything the old port could do and more. I can't wait for the day when one cable can be used as a laptop charger, phone charger, and HDMI cable.",removecomment

AutoModerator,New Account Removal < 3,"okay, so not really any love for brokers from me . . .

. . . but y'all are morons if you think ticketmaster, promoters and  artists ""hate"" scalpers.  They literally create them.  Intentionally.

Because it means they can set simple price points and sell out stadiums AND make more money.  The alternative is much riskier.

Put another way: you COULD (if you do it JUST RIGHT) make just as much  money on ticket sales with a 1/2 full arena and a ""properly"" priced  market.  But then they would all die on merch and concessions, AND have a  pissed off artist and promoter who looks like they can't draw the  venues they book.

But instead, until 2018 ticketmaster OWNED ITS OWN RESELLER MARKETPLACES.  GET IT?

The reseller market is a DEMAND CUSHION created BY AND FOR the ticketing agencies and the promoters and venues they work for.

If they wanted it to go away, they would price differently.  Instead, they  throw that entire margin to the brokers because its not worth the risk  of not selling as many $15 Bud Lights.  These people aren't stupid.

Ticket scalpers are not that far from independent, un-contracted employees.  They perform a service for the ticketing  agencies/teams/venues/artists/promoters.  I'm sorry to be the one  informing you of this.  It's the  billionaire-who's-sports-team-you-worship's fault.  Fucking duh.

f1uk3r,remove,There was contact. You can’t say definitively whether his hand actually hit lebrons nuts but there was contact in the groin area. I thought a tech for both would’ve been fine. The flagrant did seem soft for the finals. But draymond knew his situation prior he never should’ve done anything to risk another tech.,removecomment

f1uk3r,remove,Yeah but that was one time with the elbow to the nuts. He wasn’t a repeat offender. And that’s still not why draymond got suspended. Draymond got suspended cause he accrued so many techs that he was at the limit by the time the finals started. So no lebron was never in the same situation as draymond where he was ever at risk of suspension.,removecomment

If we all stayed inside for the next month without leaving our homes once, it would go away because there wouldn't be more infections.

If you know that you playing basketball doesn't help this situation and could be putting people at risk if in touch with them, why are you still doing it? We all know it's hard to stay home for a long period of time but the longer we adjourn this isolation, the longer the virus will be around (contrary to what you've been stating), just make an effort, for the sake of everyone else that is doing that effort, to be careful.

Second of all, no, we shouldnt try to keep the number of cases as low as possible as that would extend this pandemic too long to the point that the economy is absolutely tanked and the resulting fallout is even worse. The real goal is to find the perfect point where the total deaths of the impact of corona and a decline in the economy is at its lowest.",removecomment
f1uk3r,remove,"In a perfect world we would be all isolated and in less than a month it would be over yes. Then why are you still playing basketball outside? Do your part.

You think by playing basketball outside you're helping to flatten the curve? What? The more people outside, the higher the chance it is they get infected, hence the number of cases will be higher and it translates into more people in the Hospitals and number of deaths as well.",removecomment
f1uk3r,remove,"Yes I still play baskerball and I know its not the smartest thing to do, but I have taken other protective measures and drastically decreased the amount of people I come into contact on a daily basis.

No I never stated that me playing basketball will help flatten the curve.

Yes, the amount of *active* cases will be higher if we didn't quarentine, but about the same total amount of people will end up having gotten infected.

Pull up any flatten the curve graph and they will all show you that more quarentine and social distancing will only increase the total duration of this pandemic which was my whole point in the first place.",removecomment

f1uk3r,remove,"Sorry but you should inform yourself on the situation. I'm a Nursing student, all you said was just plain wrong. More exposure means more cases, this virus spreads quite easily and it takes 2 weeks to for it to act, so there will be infected people that without knowing will be infecting others. Plus, the more cases in the Hospital, the worse it gets in there and it doesn't mean outside the Hospital the situation is better, because it likely isn't. The bigger the strain on the Hospitals, the likelier it is that health care providers will become infected and will have to be treated or quarantined themselves, putting an even bigger strain on the Hospital.

Just stay home when you can. You don't know who's infected and if you're already infected, so don't go out infecting others.",removecomment
f1uk3r,remove,"Yes? Youre not thinking clearly if you think otherwise.

Exposing more people to corona means that they get it and it goes away after some time and develop immunity/resistance to it, or in some cases they die. 

If we wanted corona to pass over faster then we would've never quarantined, however it would also put a huge strain on hospitals and it would result in way more deaths so obviously it wouldnt be the smartest idea to do that.",removecomment

AutoModerator,Spam TLD blacklist: that.In,"Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson is the best passer of all time




A revolutionary player who brought unique skills at the point guard position,Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson is the greatest passer in the NBA History





He made passing an art form and took it on a whole new level like few have.His ability to dish the ball in so many different way such as no looks,behind the back and so on.His rare assist numbers don't tell always the story





His court vision was phenomenal,one of the top ever.He was the best at sharing the rock on the fast brake as many highlights are the proof for that.In terms of style,no one is better than Johnson.He had such a flare





Not only that he had rare assist numbers,but according to his team mates back in the day Kareem and Worthy,he gave you room to do your magic while he was leading you to the easy points




He captured 4 assist titles,led the league 3 times in assists through his career.In the playoffs,he had even higher averages that made a lot of impact for sure.His career total of 10141 dimes is 4th on the all time list but his career average of 11.2 is the best ever





Let's not forget his 12.1 dimes in the playoffs as well",removecomment

AutoModerator,Negative Karma Removal,"I have played against a few actually. In high school, I played at a prep school in New England, a lot of the best players from the East Coast end up at one of these schools. I played against Donovan Mitchell and Devonte Graham - they were actually on the same team. Their team was basically twelve deep with D1 talent so those two actually did not have to do much, and we still got completely smoked (our team was acutally really good itself). Warm up lines were very entertaining to watch. They had such high, effortless, speed. And their fakes and dribble moves were just so convincing. I was a rotation player, and spent some time guarding both of them, and basically felt like my shoes were nailed to the floor. They weren't though, I just suck.

Some lesser known players I played against during the same time period are Noah Vonleh, Wayne Selden, Terance Mann, Bruce Brown, and plenty more high major guys who are probably drifting around the G-League and European leagues. I could go on and on about these guys. I think Wayne Selden caught a 360 alley oop in game, and also hit eight 3s. Noah Vonley was basically a 6'10 point guard, who also just made every shot.

If you did not know, ESPN ranks the top 100 high school basketball recruits. At the time I actually had a player ranked in the top 30 on my team. So I played against him basically everyday for two years. He was a super bouncy PF. I think he plays in Europe now after having a slightly disappointing college career at a high major program. In pick up games within our team, it was fairly common for him to 360 windmill on a breakaway. He definitely had serious aspirations of making the NBA - at the time me and my teammates thought he could go one and done. In college he was mostly a rebounder and all around athlete, but in high he could basically do whatever he wanted, even against the best competition in the country. In practice I honestly think he dunked on me 30 - 40 times; a few of which definitely could have made ESPN if someone was filming; I think i am in the clear though",removecomment

The achilles he tore was on was not on the leg he jumps from plus looking at his workouts he still looks pretty damn fast.

 John Wall himself says that this is the most healthiest that he's been since his rookie year or something like that. Which is reasonably because he's been carrying the team for a long time but now that Beal is a top SG in the nba he doesn't have to carry a lot.

If this was the 90s or 2000s when the league was at it's most physical, then yea I would be a little concerned but in TODAY'S nba where teams allow dudes to walk in the lane and defense is sooooo weak, I'm not worried about Wall one bit. I predict that he'll average around 18 pts, 10 asts, 6 rebs, 1.5 stls, 0.9 blks next season.

That said, although he was a phenomenal NBA star, his on-court behavior was reprehensible enough to make him one of the most hated players in the game without bringing in his scandalous personal life.

AutoModerator,Negative Karma Removal,"
Advanced stats (Especially Metrics based on PBP data like PIPM/Raptor/RAPM) don’t entirely Measure True Impact or True creation . They have collinearity issues, they Don’t filter for schemes, roster construction & fit. 

What Creation and/or impact metrics tells us is  actually “Philadelphia is 3 points per 48 minutes better than the opposing lineups in stints that included Tobias Harris.” Unfortunately, we do not have an unlimited parentheses unfortunately, we do not have an unlimited amount of Trials to test out every possible lineup featuring Harris.This means that we cannot know how much of the three point differential is attributable to Harris. We also will not be able to tell us how those lineups would perform without harass against the same opponent lineups.

What we can do is use a prior to represent what we believe a player’s impact to have been with other lineups in other seasons. This allows us to correct outliers among low minute players, but does not tell us any more about what has happened in the season under consideration


Also, Curry’s creation for me is in line with Kawhi/KD but below Harden/ LeBron. 


He’s not really a a great passer imo. A guy like Durant creates Far better off the dribble. On any randomized Possession, KD will take his man off the dribble & find the open man far better than Curry will. with Curry the ball ends up in draymond’s hands a lot once he Can’t establish separation on his defender. He doesn’t have great vision where he's making elite creation plays (passes) where there aren't seemingly points. He's 2nd or 3rd on the team in assists every year despite being 1st in USG% & touches (yes, even more than KD

Curry also plays with Statistically the best passing team in NBA history. When Warriors run 2 or 3 screens for him & he gets trapped, Warriors zip it around the court with incredible accuracy and Vision. Guys like Livingston, Iggy, Dray are very High IQ, they are also able to find Steph offball with ease.

If Steph played on a standard NBA team, with average passers, Low Iq players, An average coach, decent defensive talent, the offense would drop off heavily.

I think majority of NBA fans Believe Durant to be better because It’s incredibly easy to build a contender around him. Just surround him with A lowry/Rubio type, and A few rebounders & you’re in contention.   He masks a lot of weaknesses  Bc he’s so versatile on both sides of the ball, he plays 4 positions on offense and 3-4 on defense.

With Steph, You need much more. An elaborate screening scheme (warriors run most of off ball screens per game), Very good coaching & play calling, A Playmaking 4 that’s operated in space (Draymond) & You always have to have Elite POA defenders. 

There’s just very little repeatability with Steph on a randomized set of teammates than W/ a KD or LeBron for example. I roll with Durant for these reasons but I’m not totally Against Curry, especially if you have An insane foundation already. I didn’t mean to sound condescending if I come off that way.",removecomment

AutoModerator,Banned Word - niggas,"Joe Rogan disagrees with y’all lol, I think I’ll value his opinion over the dribble in here. Lebron is arguably the best athlete in the world... faster and stronger at his weight than anyone else in the league, I don’t know much about hockey but if this guy is the same weight and height as lebron as it says I highly doubt anyone in here knows enough to say he’s stronger, let alone waaaay stronger than lebron?? Lebron might be the strongest athlete at his weight not counting bodybuilders. And you seriously believe if they were going to have a Logan Paul vs ksi type showdown where each of them could train for a lil while so the fighting experience would be a even playing field, that lebron wouldn’t have a chance? Y’all clearly smoking crack 😂ffs have y’all seen what that man can do with his body? If he was a mma fighter instead of basketball no one would be surprised if he was the ufc heavyweight champion. Think I’m full of shit? Y’all know who the real ufc heavyweight champion is rn? Another guy from Ohio, stipe miocic, him and lebron support each other and before stipe became a mma fighter and then heavyweight champion, he was just a great d1 baseball player. But with a background in wrestling, great fight iq, and incredible athleticism for his size, he was able to become arguably the best heavyweight fighter we’ve seen so far. (Yes there’s more to it than that, but I see no reason why you’d assume lebron wouldn’t have the same intangibles necessary.)Which technically puts Stipe in the conversation for baddest man to ever live😂and he would have a valid argument to that. Even boxers concede mma is more of a realistic fight, and the baddest man on the planet went from being heavyweight champion boxer in the 90’s (Mike Tyson), to now everyone acknowledging that the ufc heavyweight champion is considered the baddest man. You know what stipe’s thoughts on if lebron did mma were when someone asked him right after he won the belt? Thank god that he doesn’t cuz I’d be out of a job 😂not verbatim but you get the point. I’m a huge fan of ufc and that topic of what sports players in other sports would be good fighters is debated a lot by the Sports analysts , and lebron is easily the athlete that’s brought up the most. Why? Because simply his level of athleticism is uncharted territory in combat sports, that, combined with his very high iq (ask anyone) , skill and agility unprecedented for his size in the nba let alone the ufc,while fighting heavyweights who the majority of which will be smaller than him, slower reflexes, weaker, less durable, less explosive? And trust me, you can’t even rely on being more skilled or fighting more intelligently, he’s the sports player of the decade for more than just his athleticism. Honestly, it would be a foolish bet to assume if this dude did decide to go the mma route when he was a kid, that he wouldn’t be competing against the best of the best, and prolly winning against those niggas too. And even now, if he had even a month training,  with the martial arts he already did(y’all niggas didn’t consider that either did ya?) he would work any 43 year old non professional fighter who wants it😂this dude is supposed to compete against a dude a decade younger than him who if the ages were reversed would prolly still be more athletic than you?😂come on now y’all asking to much of my guy chara, I peeped some of his fights and mans can scrap but he’s already had enough concessions keep him away from bron lol let my man rest his wife prolly going through menapause

Lin wasn't traded. He got injured that year. He was a restricted RFA and the Rockets offered such a huge contract that the Knicks didn't want to match.

Lin wasn't that good and there were concerns he wasn't going to be the same when he recovered.

You want to watch basketball go on YouTube and watch all the classic games subscribe to ESPN Plus if you need your fix so bad.

AutoModerator,Banned Word - Rape,"These things are compatible


100% agreed that Asian people have faced tons of racism in the US as well. The Chinese Exclusion Act is one of the best examples, where the full weight of the government was placed behind a racist policy. Or the internment camps during world war II


Also agreed that things are more difficult to parse out between some Asian countries. Still, there are lasting scars from things like the Rape of Nanking and Japanese occupation of South Korea that give an extra heft to discrimination between those groups. 


I'm not an expert and don't claim to be - still, it seems clear to me that historical injustices and current power dynamics are the key differences between discrimination and racism.",removecomment

AutoModerator,New Account Removal < 3,"He did, and he did so more than Pippen.  Contrary to popular opinion, Michael Jordan – not Scottie Pippen –   most often drew the opposition’s toughest perimeter assignment. However,  it was close: Jordan did so 8 times, while Scottie Pippen assumed this  responsibility 7 times.  


***After reviewing the game film from the  1991 NBA Finals, it turns out the Jordan – not Pippen – guarded Magic  Johnson for nearly 85-90% of that series. The exception was the first  half of Game 2 and the 2H of Game 3.***  


**Out of 24 playoff  series, Michael Jordan – not Scottie Pippen -guarded the better   perimeter player more often. Specifically,Jordan guarded the better  perimeter player during 13 playoff series, while Pippen guarded the  better perimeter player 11 times.**  


So Pippen only guarded  Magic for 2 halves....and yet most people think he guarded him most of  the series. Its amazing what some highlights, reputation, and word of  mouth can do.  


I would say 1998 is a tie tho, I know Reggie was the Pacers best player but Pippen guarded Mark Jackson which was crucial....  


But still it is a HUGE myth that Pippen mostly guarded the other teams best player.",removecomment

I'm not sure that anyone besides Detroit did that. In an era dominated by big centers and forwards, he was the first straight up shooter type to be winning 50-60+ games with his shooting style being the dominant threat. He was a tough SOB too and I think he'd tear this league up right now. He was always a playoff performer and is one of the few that turned up his play in the playoffs.

A living wage is one in which a person working 40 hours a week can afford all the necessities (shelter, clothing, a phone, health care, etc.) as well as have enough left over at the end of the month for an emergency fund (so that you can actually take a breath that isn't tainted by the pressure of wondering what happens if you miss just one paycheck and maybe not be terrified about your financial situation every waking second). 

THAT is a living wage. It will be different depending on the state and even city, and not everyone will be diligent about saving, but what I outlined isn't outrageous or impossible.",removecomment

So you're actually advocating that workers become the ruling class, because there is no other way to exert such a cap on wealth, which means you're actually arguing for socialism, which means we need to forcefully seize land and factories and distribution networks while abolishing IP.

That being said, he was the first player ever to be suspended for conduct that wasn’t on the wrong side of the law.",removecomment
AutoModerator,Brigade Protection,"Nah. 

If you watched the games you would see a couple of things:

1. As u/LuckysBestMan said, Brown was playing fine after recovering from his injuries. To the point where he was probably one of our most consistently good players towards the end of the season. 

2. Hayward and Brown ended up working really closely for most of the season. Because they were both in charge of running the bench, you would see those two separating from the group and forming their own huddles during the game to strategise.

 They went from being one of the worst duos in the league (when they were both working through injuries), to being a NET positive.

What really hurt us was the finger-pointing and that was predominantly started (at least publicly) by Kyrie and Morris. 


We had team-wide problems with effort, attention to detail and communication. Kyrie and Morris made it seem like it was a youth issue and because we had a culture of finger-pointing we never developed a culture of personal responsibility. 

You have to understand, Kyrie and Morris were the ones publicly speaking out the most, they ended up setting the narrative. 

Fans/Media ate that shit up because there's not a whole lot of critical game analysis going on in the NBA media, most of it is highlights and regurgitated quotes.

There was a lot of unanswered hate towards Brown and Rozier early on. 

And then we had two big turning points in terms of perception:

1. We actually had a former Washington Wizards' scout come into our sub with a [breakdown of a game](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/apqz7y/former_nba_scout_and_video_coordinator_bryan/). What he showed was that while Brown and Rozier were gambling too much and making junior mistakes. The really big issue was the senior players taking shortcuts and making the other guys look bad and also blaming other guys (and he tears into Morris).
 * Guys weren't properly rotating defensively which would leave other defenders exposed. 
 * Guys weren't properly running the full length of the court in defensive transition.
 * etc etc. 

    This is a pretty good example from our Milwaukee series of [Kyrie doing it to Morris](https://twitter.com/ZachLowe_NBA/status/1125832190967918593). Now, if that play was Kyrie and Brown and ended with Middleton getting a wide-open 3 or easy backdoor cut, what you would have seen is Kyrie calling out Brown. Even though it was Kyrie fucking up. 


2. The Milwaukee series really cleared a lot of the smoke around Kyrie's on-court effort. Because he wasn't performing well offensively, people started noticing his defensive shortcomings.

On the topic of Kyrie calling out his teammates, [I did a breakdown of his Charlotte game](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/epen6c/kyrie_irving_after_tonights_loss_to_the_76ers_i/fejubuw/), but there were other examples throughout the season.",removecomment

In r/baseball here are some good ones:  

Someone asked for a story where they met a player and he was an ass to them. A commenter told a story about meeting Troy Tulowitzki that seemed... dubious, wherein Tulo allegedly told two kids to go back to their bitch parents. The top response to that comment was: ""One time I was at YYZ just minding my own business doing a Sudoku when I hear ""hey fuck face!"" I lower my book and Tulo shoots me right in the fucking throat with a nail gun."" So that gets recycled a lot kind of like the Navy SEAL copy pasta.

They even got back in touch a few years back after he figured out social media. They send each other family photos, swap work stories (they are all retired) and occasionally even skype on holidays. Last thanksgiving, I was over at my dad's and Josh was visiting while they were skyping. His mom knows from my dad that I'm a huge baseball fan and she offered to introduce us. Well, Josh would have none of it. First he pretended to not hear her while she awkwardly made excuses for him that he was busy preparing the turkey in the kitchen (we could see him right behind her coloring with crayons or some shit), but then he rolled his eyes and said ""for fuck's sake"" loud enough for us to hear. He finally came over into full view and I shit you not, was wearing a bib and holding massive turkey legs in each of his hands. He didn't say a goddamn word. No hello or hi or even a smile.

Rockstar408,remove,"Every QB in the league plays with the air pressure in the footballs because the league let teams supply their own. Brady’s were probably right at the lower boundary at the start of the game but the cold temps dropped the pressure below the limit. A bunch of educators have used this to teach the relevant chemistry/physics. Check out the last couple pages [here](http://chemistrye.weebly.com/uploads/3/7/7/0/37707825/gas_laws_case_study.pdf).  The fact that the league lets each team supply its own balls for the game, never recorded pressures prior to the game, and had never checked them during the game prior to that particular game, should probably tell you how much the league cared about the air pressure before this.  

A ball that is fully inflated in the locker room (to the maximum PSI of 13.5) would still be under the minimum legal pressure if the game was played at a temp roughly 20 degrees colder than the room they were stored in before the initial measurement. Considering the sport is played in the fall and winter, that’s probably a large chunk of games. 

That said, even if they were under inflating the balls, there’s zero evidence this actually means anything to the ability to throw or catch it. No one has actually tested in any meaningful way the effect of the relative inflation level of a football on how easy it is to throw or catch. The NFL’s rules appear to be based solely on the manufacturer’s recommendations. 

What the falcons were doing almost certainly had more of an impact on the results of games. There wasn’t a 35 million dollar fishing expedition in to that one, tho, or a couple hundred pages of reports that scientists mostly scoffed at.",removecomment

Granted Wade missed about 30 and 20 games two of those seasons, but the Heat really should have a better average record than 43-39.

AutoModerator,Negative Karma Removal,"So basically create a good team filled with veteran role players and stock up on assets to pull the trigger when a superstar becomes available.  Sounds like a good strategy, but I think there are so many ways to screw it up.  Just looking at the Pistons, they really don’t have any assets outside of Luke Kennard and wasted their one opportunity to stockpile some more by not trading Drummond earlier.  Also keep in mind it’s extremely difficult to win a championship in the NBA.  I’d say you need at least one top 5 and one top ten player and competent vets, or three players in the 10-15 range or better just to be in contention.  So even if the Pistons were getting a healthy peak performance Griffin, it still wouldn’t be enough.

This morning, at 4:30AM, our Prime Minister was served a criminal indictment by the US for corporate & financial crimes. Media owners were instructed to historically brainwash everyone that PM has Corona Virus with his wife and that they wont be leaving their house for a while.

>Tom Hanks was arrested 48hrs ago for Pedophilia and he is currently being kept in a Hotel room in Australia refusing to fly back to USA. Next celebrity arrests will be Celion Dion, Madonna, Charley Barkley, Kevin Spacey - all will claim Corona virus infections.

>Italy's airports have been completely shut down as over 80 of Vatican and financial officials have been served same criminal indictments for financial crime, pedophilia, child trafficking and sex abuse.

>United Emirates have completed mass arrests of their own Royal Family & affiliates.

>Convicted Hollywood rapist Harvey Weinstein agreed to a deal in exchange for his testimony against hundreds of top Hollywood celebrities and their involvement in the drug business, pedophilia and child trafficking. Instead of 55 year sentence, he only received 23y sentence. In exchange, he provided testimonies against some of the biggest & most powerful names including Prince Andrew of UK, former president Bill Clinton, former vice president Joe Biden, Tom Hanks, Oprah, Ellen DeGenerous, Quentin Tarantino, Charlie Sheen, Bob Saget, Kevin Spacey, John Travolta, Steven Spielberg, Podesta, NXIVM and PIZZAGATE sex trafficking clubs, and hundreds of more who all were directly involved with Jeffrey Epstein. In exchange of Jeffrey Epstein's testimony, he was allowed to make a deal and have his suicide in prison faked.

>CEOs of some major world corporations have been indicted/arrested and some forced to resign all in the last 30-60 days, such as CEO of NBA, Harley Davidson, Gates Foundation, Intel, McDonald's, Cesar Awards, Vatican Chief of Police, Disney..etc Approximately 700-800 more resignations are coming in the next 3 months.

>Lab-created Corona Virus is a cover up for mass mandatory vaccination agenda, as well a covert US Intelligence operation that the world has ever seen and this mass 158,000 arrest operation will remove & capture the biggest evil & corrupted politicians, celebrities and CEOs including global elites and bankers such as George Soros, UN officials, founders of GRETA INC.

>Trump will win 2020 elections and arrests of former US presidents will occur in early 2021. All major arrests will be covered by media as an accident or conspiracy theory. All arrested individuals will be given ""Rommel Death"" meaning choice between suicide/accidental death in return for assurances that his/her reputation will remain intact, or face criminal trial that would result in public disgrace.

>Some top religious leaders will be arrested or forced to resign, some will get ""Sick"" suddenly. Vatican will be the first and the Pope will be removed in 2020. Production of human extracted Adrenochrome will be revealed and Hollywood and Vatican will be directly responsible for it.

>Coming up there will be a 2 month complete shut down of the worlds most common operations such as schools, stock exchange, some Banks, airports, shipping, travel, events, galas, expos, sport games, sport championships, music award ceremonies, NBA/NHL/Baseball games, ship cruises including food shortage and staged electricity power loss. Gas prices will go down, food costs will go up, insurance will go up, Gold/silver stocks will fall, many corporations will either bankrupt or take a significant financial loss such as whats about to happen to Air Canada, Disney and Coca Cola. H5N1 bird flu will be intentionally released this week out of China.

No, instead he published a bullshit summary of the Meuller Report until enough people lost interest, when he should have released the whole damn thing.

So how does this work *in a practical sense?*

One obvious question is how you motivate people/companies to fund improvements to a given location. For example, I recently shelled out a decent amount of money for a number of home improvements. These ranged from ""absolutely necessary (new roof)"" to ""not necessary but contributed to the overall quality of the house (energy efficient water heater, new paint and carpet, etc). 

If I don't actually own the land, then why would I ever do that? I mean, if the government can decide tomorrow to allocate my land to someone that they have ""determined"" needs it more, then why would I spend money on any of that stuff? I'd probably even put off the things like a new roof as long as I possibly could because there is nothing saying that I wouldn't get kicked out in a month and forced into another house that also needs a new roof.

Napoleon brought with him sweeping social reforms, introduced a civil code which to this day serves as the basis of many countries’ legal system, created high schools, created the Bank of France, brought back exiled nobles, brought back freedom of religion, and undertook vast successful military conquests which consolidated his country as the premier power in Europe. And if it weren’t for him, Italy and Germany probably wouldn’t exist, as his wars led to a surge in nationalism in these areas.
Sure, there was some control over the press, and he brought back slavery in the colonies, but the highs far outweigh the lows. The truth is the majority of the French people adored Napoleon.",removecomment

I disregarded the rest of your “argument” because it’s nonsense, you can’t be older than 14, nobody needed you to write 3 paragraphs to try to prove that centers are tall lmao all anyone was saying is that center is a position usually played by the tallest player, but to say the tallest player is the “de facto center” is just outright wrong especially in the nba.

Consider that Vo, Italy is the only city to test all of their population of 1350 after the first person showed symptoms and they discovered that 103 people already had it but showed 0 signs and felt fine. That means more than 99% of the population may have an opportunity to get it and he completely unaffected.

Initial reports estimated 33% of people are unaffected. A week later they estimated 70-90% of people are unaffected. The only numbers that aren't estimates shows greater than 99% may not be effected by the virus.

People will downvote me for reassuring you with the truth, but I work at an American hospital and see a **complete lack** of deadly outbreak of any kind every day.

And the truth is starting to leak out if you can ignore the doomsayers long enough to keep your head. As the dust settles on Italy and we see how empty and manipulated their statistics were, “Covid-19” is now no longer even classified as a high consequence infectious disease in the UK.

This is a huge distortion. The range I've read is from 40% to 70%, and the vast majority of cases are mild (80%).

You do a huge disservice by automatically projecting the worst case scenario.

If Italy is the worse case, the avg age of those that died is in the 80s. 

People *need* to go back to work. Millions live paycheck to paycheck - they cannot just not work. Unrest can lead to looting and violence, which can also overload the system.

Again, you have very little life experience to understand the downstream effects. Your view is myopic - you only understand the hysteria in front of you, and you immediately jump to the worst case scenario *as your base case*. A complete fallacy.",removecomment

KD doesnt need Steph to score 50 points. And if you think KD is an afterthought go look at what Lou Williams and Pat Bev said about defending KD in this series.
Every top point god has that type of gravity, the problem is that they don't have a playmaker like Draymond to make them pay. Just take James harden and Lilliard. Harden get double team all the team but when he gives the ball to Tucker, the ball stays stuck and there is no action. Or take Lilliard against the pelicans in the playoffs, he got double teamed all serie by jrue and rondo, and when he gives the ball nobody knows how to move the ball to find the open man. So those plays that draymond does ain't easy and few power forwad can make it. So this gravity is effective also because of draymond ability to make each time the right play.

The average net worth of Americans aged 70-79 is 1.1 million he's got 2 million, really not living like some king and it's not mental gymnastics to explain to you how he inherited a home and has a one bedroom apartment to go along with his modest house.   If he wasn't a senator and house representative making the salary that he makes he wouldn't have been able to enact any change at all, and he wrote a book people decided to buy that's about him fighting for political change, doesn't go against anything he believes in, he's fine with people making money he literally just wants rich people to pay more taxes... Like I said he's advocating for extremely wealthy people to pay taxes, for the massively rich to pay their workers a fair and livable wage not 1/40,000 of what they make, for a healthcare system that will be cheaper than our current system costing the average American less while guaranteeing comprehensive coverage for every American while our current system leaves ~80mil Americans underinsured or completely uninsured and has completely reshaped the political discourse of one of two political parties in the us. Look at exit polling in literally every primary so far that shows widespread support for m4a and tell me he hasn't done anything, when soon it will become political necessity for Dems to back a policy that would keep 60k people a year from needlessly dying from lack of healthcare/ unafforable coverage. He's been the leading voice on raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and has succeeded in doing that in a number of states. He's gotten major funding for local community health centers that help the underserved with vital services. He's defended poc lgbtq and women's rights since long before it was a politically viable strategy to do so. He's pushed to stop cuts to social security and succeeded in doing so multiple times, he's fought for funding for the VA so veterans aren't abandoned by the govt they served. All this success in helping people but it's all just self serving and inexcusable for him to work in one of the few jobs that he can push for meaningful reform in bc he's given a good salary to do so??? Democratic socialism isn't about making sure no one is wealthy, it's about making sure those that aren't have sufficient safety nets to keep them from needlessly dying from lack of health coverage, lack of a living wage etc. He's argued against having massive donors backing political campaigns that lead to the wealthy having an undue say on policy, and shown that a grassroots, small donor campaign is viable. He's passed so many amendments that have helped working class people throughout the last 30 years man.  Saying he's contributed basically nothing to society is blatantly false, he might not have succeeded in every one of his efforts, but he's completely changed the political landscape of our country and the fact that he's getting 80+ % support of people 30 and under suggest that his ideas will have a very lasting impact on this country and the world",removecomment

Policies her and Bernie both advocated for while Biden has not and will not include: legalizing weed, enacting a wealth tax, ending fracking, getting rid of superpacs/ large money donors influence in politics, getting rid of superdelegates, cover everyone on govt run health insurance and eliminate private insurance, consider a job guarantee, focus deportations only on criminals and security threats, make college free etc etc. She was loudly anti superpac but then cashed a 14.5 mil check from one silicon valley exec while claiming Bernie had superpacs (because a youth led climate action group and a nurses union chose to endorse him and gave him pennies compared to Liz's superpac, and are funded by small donations which are completely dif than being funded by a few extremely rich donors that you're then beholden too) and had been very anti super delegates going against the will of the people only until she knew she couldn't win a majority and decided she actually was okay with that if it meant her having a chance when her campaign was all but dead. And whether you think Bernie defines progressivism he was the only other progressive in the race and she willingly chose to attack him again and again, like when she all of a sudden got mad at him for something he supposedly said 8 months prior (while remaining on friendly terms with him in the interim) and loudly condemning Bernie again and again claiming he needs to be responsible for every anonymous Twitter account that says anything mean (which he did in fact denounce) while doing nothing to denounce her supporters saying heinous shit on there constantly as well. If random people tweeting snake emojis at you for you going back on things you've claimed to believe in for years is enough to not support the only candidate left in the race that had similar policiess, I think it's fair to say Warren doesn't actually give a shit about the things she's claimed to for all these years and it's pretty hard to make a case she's progessive after her actions had a huge contribution in stiffling any chance of a progessive movement making any real strides",removecomment

They held a video conference yesterday (3/24) advising all employees that even in the event the government specifically declares them as NOT exempt from a shelter in place order, they will challenge it.

Because the corporate honchos in Houston know more than the governments, scientists, and doctors around the world urging people to stay home and flatten the curve.

As part of the official company response, we have been instructed to post ""cleaning logs"" around the store that we sign to ""prove"" we clean the stores twice a day. 

Cleaning supplies are low and none are available in local grocery stores. Corporate gave everyone a $50 credit for Office Depot online, which has also been OOS on everything. When asked on the conference call what to do when the supplies available do run out, we were told to ask our DMs to buy some locally.

Think about how many beds and pillows the average customer touches and lays on while picking out a new bed. And then please consider the staggering amount of Lysol/ Clorox cans a store would need to have stocked up in the back to constantly sanitize each and every surface that is touched. Granted, we do offer pillow protectors - that are kept stacked in an open-to-the-air box and touched by every single guest who goes to grab one. Now finally ask yourself if you still feel like that is a truly sanitary environment to shop in right now?

Don't worry though, there's some great news! If you get sick while working this essential position, you get unpaid furlough and no disaster/emergency pay. Also they froze accrued PTO so no sick pay either. But they can't get supplies out to these essential businesses and employees to keep them sanitized and safe to work in. 

It's not only unethical, I believe it is (or at least should be) illegal. They are actively fighting against flattening the curve just so they don't lose even more sales than they already have.",removecomment

Yeah his whopping 3 rings in 16 years really shows that lmfao 

> Lebron is a winning system by himself he’s just played on shit teams 9 of his 15 years.

I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called ""Linux"", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called ""Linux"" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.",removecomment

AutoModerator,Spam TLD blacklist: self.post,"I know this is 6 days ago but I just saw I saved this post and you replied so I need to share this with someone

If you look right at the beginning of the last clip you can see Steph IMMEDIATELY see draymond coming and then looks over his other shoulder and sees the water

Then you see dray walK behind him but then Steph turns head SLIGHTLY and his eyes start flicking that way to see when Green picks up the cup. He saw it all before it even happened and hit the perfect shot

It happens so fast it seems like random luck almost but when you look at it closely it’s clear he knew exactly what he was doing

AutoModerator,New Account Removal < 3,"What do they do if an outbreak develops while they're at this 'neutral' location?

All you need is for one person to test positive and that'll more than send people into a frenzy. It's not as simple as just quarantining them.  If an NBA player tests positive, it means they've had it at least for 2-14 days (since it seems we're only testing people when exhibiting symptoms) and could've spread it to anyone within that time period. That means family, coaches, teammates, other players - who will all need to be tested now. 

The optics of this is absolutely horrible for the NBA - wasting limited test kits so that basketball can finish this season is absurd. And if it's a 'neutral' city that develops an outbreak because the NBA moved there, the perception of the NBA would become worse than the NFL",removecomment

Kevin Love - On the play before the Hill free throws the Cavs are winning by 2. Kevin Love makes one of the most disgusting soft fouls ever.

Danny Green’s salary this year is $14,634,147.

Players typically get paid biweekly. The regular season is about 6 months. Danny Green makes a cool half mil every two weeks if paid only during the regular season, or .5mil/month if spread out year round. 

I like Danny Green, but damn. 
That’s so much money. 

That’s over $40k/day. 

It’s hard for me to feel a lot of sympathy for him when he makes more money in a day than a solid 1/3 of American households make in a year.

AutoModerator,Spam TLD blacklist: www.who.int,"> Your ""actual data"" is compiled by non public health / medical experts 

The dataset they analyze actually comes from a joint effort between China and the WHO, which you can find here:

https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf

Are you saying the Doctors who shared this data with the WHO are not medical experts?

> they make a fundamental error which is that the dataset they use skews towards people who needed medical treatment (""laboratory confirmed cases"")

Laboratory confirmed means the infection was confirmed by a laboratory (experts) not that medical treatment was required.  China was aggressively testing people based on contact with others, not just when they felt ill. Asymptomatic cases are in fact part of the dataset and since China was at the forefront of the outbreak, this is the most comprehensive and long term (timeline) data set released to date.

Meanwhile the data you shared doesn’t really have long term symptomatic outcomes  because:

> Soon after identification of the first infections, both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases were transported to designated medical facilities specialised in infectious diseases in Japan. However, these patients were treated as external (imported) cases, and a detailed description of their clinical progression is not publicly available.",removecomment

AutoModerator,Offensive  Word - cuck,"I cannot think or comprehend of anything more cucked than having a daughter. Honestly, think about it rationally. You are feeding, clothing, raising and rearing a girl for at least 18 years solely so she can go and get ravaged by another man. All the hard work you put into your beautiful little girl - reading her stories at bedtime, making her go to sports practice, making sure she had a healthy diet, educating her, playing with her. All of it has one simple result: her body is more enjoyable for other men.
Raised the perfect girl? Great. Who benefits? If you're lucky, a random man who had nothing to do with the way she grew up, who marries her. He gets to ravage her every night. He gets the benefits of her kind and sweet personality that came from the way you raised her.
As a man who has a daughter, you are LITERALLY dedicating at least 20 years of your life simply to raise a girl for another man to enjoy. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck. Think about it logically.",removecomment

SHE CONSENTED TO HAVE HER PARTNER FILM HER WITH THE INTENTION THAT ONLY HE WOULD SEE IT. SHE DID NOT CONSENT TO YOU AND OTHERS NECKBEARD ASSES TO JACK THEIR MEAT TO IT. JAMAL WAS AT FAULT FOR MISTAKENLY PUTTING THIS ON HIS IG STORY. SHE DID NOTHING WRONG.

AutoModerator,Negative Karma Removal,"This. Even with KLove’s and Irving’s defendive shortcomings, these three created historic offenses. The narrative of “James making Love less effective” would be looked at completely differently had Love/Kyrie not been injured in 2015 and had KD not joined the Warriors in 2017.

In 2015, when they had some defenders (e.g., Shumpert who played was defending like a top 5 defensive wing),they could play both offense and defense. In their last 36 games together, they went 33-3 and had an SRS around +14 to +15.

2016 playoffs: +13 SRS (top 5 playoffs offense)

2017 playoffs: +14 SRS (best raw playoffs offense)

These are all time numbers, but sadly for them, the KD Added Turbo Warriors came about.

Take a look at these pairings:

Kobe/Shaq, +9.1, +10.9, +8.4, +10.1 in ‘01, ‘02, ‘03, ‘04 respectively;
KD/Westbrook, +12.8 in 2016, +10.6 in 2015, +7.5 in 2014, +10.8 in 2013, +7.0 in 2012, +2.6 in 2011, +5.8 in 2010

James With Love, 2016,+12.0

James With Love, 2015, +11.8

James With Kyrie, 2015, +11.0

James With Kyrie, 2017, +10.2

James With Love, 2017, +10.1

Those are better numbers than the numbers Shaq and Kobe paired to put together. How can that be a failed pairing?

Lastly, about Love being “marginalized.” If you use a player to create an all time offense, how is he being marginalized?

2014 “Minny Love” per 100 possessions as a first option

35.4/17 on 59.1% TS

2017 Cavs’ Love per 100 possessions as a third option

30.2/17.6 on 57.3% TS (took 2.1 fewer FGA/g per 100–equalize FGA and he’s at 32.6 ppg per 100 possessions)

2018 Cavs’ Love per 100 possessions as a second option

30.8/16.2 on 61.4% TS (took 3.5 fewer FGA/g per 100–equalize FGA and he’s at 35.1 ppg AS A SECOND OPTION, almost identical to Minny Love as a FIRST OPTION; of course, with 3.5 more FGA per game, he’d basically be a co-first option with Bron)

All time playoff offensive series


Here’s a list of the best offensive series in NBA history (over the last 44 years at least); the Cavs have 5 of the top 29, i.e., 50% of all Cavs’ playoff series since 2016 began have been in the top 1% of all playoff series played. They also have two best ever.

I only know how great those teams were because broadcasters talked about them during the 96-98 Jordan run, my time on basketball forums on insidehoos, realgm, etc (2009-2013). 

Anyway, here are some “blogs” about teams that never won a championship. The Dwight Magic aren’t on any of the lists, neither were the 2010 Celtics. Though the C’s won in 08, one of the articles won’t list them as it was more about multi-year squads.

Like I said, I only wanted to point out that saying journalists need to be spoonfed information is asinine. It's not like they don't know about the seriousness of the situation, they have Chinese correspondents for crying out loud. On top of that their job description is to literally do research and not just trust everything someone tells them.

LMAO okay man. The video is nothing but bullshit. The virus wasn't a big deal in America mid January at that point. No need for revisionist history. Saying that most people will get better is TRUE. Saying that it will likely be over soon is TRUE. Saying there are treatments and vaccines coming soon is TRUE. Like the majority of what he said in there is factually correct. Why can't you understand that? He has taken the measures necessary to get this under control. It's also his job to not fucking spread panic and throw us into anarchy.

Literally a week before Trump said he didn't think it was a pandemic in January the WHO was saying that human to human transmission of the disease was not happening. The entire fucking world wasn't taking it seriously at that point.

>Comparing to regular drugs development is a strawman. His intent was not ""dont worry we will have a vaccine within 12 years""

His intent is that we will have something to fight the virus in the near future. Having a vaccine ready by next flu season is fucking soon man i dont give a fuck what you say. Keep ignoring the fact that therapeutic treatments are available already. Doesn't fit your retarded narrative.

>That was a total of what 5-7 seconds of the video. How about the other 2:05? The video is date stamped, it is not trying to skew what he said, even said there are only 8 cases in America at the time. That does not dismiss the criticism of him saying ""we have shut it down"" while cases were on the rise in January, not does it address the other 95% of the video.

I addressed most of it in my previous comments. Please read slower.

>Your link about test kits having the hiccup (which I cant even read because you linked a website that forces you to create an account) does not dismiss the criticism of him saying ""as of yesterday and today anyone can get a test"" These test production errors occurred in February, it was known at the time we did not have enough tests and he lied about it.

How does it fucking not? Companies preparing and shipping tests tell trump they are ready and how many will be available now and in the future. Trump then says they're available. Then you have the issues come up. Is it that hard to follow dude?

>Now we are on to whataboutisms. I am not a fan of any of the people you have named. I have never voted democrat in my life and am just as critical to them as I am Trump. Wish you were too, but your likely part of the Trump cult who are political hacks who consistently trash the media for being fake news but never Trump who is one of the largest providers of it.

It's not whataboutism, it's admitting that the dude isn't perfect but that video is bullshit and is overplaying any apparent mishandling of the virus. 

>Please show me where you debunked that Trump did not say cases are going to go down in late February when there were 80K+ cases in the world?

AutoModerator,Brigade Protection,"A homeless person after treatment isn't homeless. Its a person in treatment, living in a halfway home perhaps. If you're imagining a ""bum"" off the streets going to a job interview at mcdonalds then you're only thinking in extremes here and not realistically. There are plenty of people who work in mcdonalds who are in treatment: therapy, 12 step program, rehab, you name it. This would be more of the same. 

Furthermore, you have to have a better argument than ""being homeless gives you PTSD"". That's not in official literature and the only people who say that as far as I know are people who aren't medical professionals giving their opinion. aka biased takes on the issue. 

Your last paragraph is where your opinion clouds your judgement imo. You start off strong by talking about parking spaces. Read this post from 2 years ago to substantiate your knowledge. Read it. https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/6lvwh4/im_an_architect_in_la_specializing_in_multifamily/. 

But, your overall main premise is wrong, and I'll tell you why. 

The main problem isn't nimbys and blocking homeless shelters, its not giving people with drug addiction and mental illness treatment FIRST. These are diseases of the mind that CANNOT be treated on your own. You need professional help from experienced medical professionals, preferably in a psychiatric setting. Its the same way you need a heart surgeon to perform a bypass surgery on you. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. That's it, bottom line kind of thing.

If you build all the shelters and affordable housing your heart desires (which will never happen btw because the free market controls these things, not govt initiatives) then it will still be a failure because housing is NOT a treatment for schizophrenia or drug addiction. Its a recipe for disaster to give schizophrenics a free house. They'll think govt spies are outside, meaning they'll never leave the house and suffer from malnutrition because they don't go grocery shopping. Many homeless people in their current state CANNOT TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES. They need professional help first before anything else, and you don't understand this because you're only looking at this from a housing POV, which is a failure of perspective.

I've read articles about formerly homeless people being given these houses and they couldn't pay their bills, keep the house clean, or generally hold their shit together. It was a disaster. This was in the NY/NJ area. 

You need to stop thinking in terms of housing and nimbys. Its liberal talking points for people who don't know anything about drug addiction or mental health beyond what they read in headlines, which I think you may fall into. I'm lucky enough to be a medical professional so I know a bit more about this, which is where my POV comes from. I've been involved in a psychiatric hospital (on the treatment side) that treated plenty of homeless people, which is why I know how treatment plans work. Everything I described is what I've seen with my own eyes. If I asked you what % of homeless people have drugs in their tox screens, your first guess would always be under what the actual answer is, for example. 

I do not mean to denigrate you. You have a lot of great points here. A lot. And you know what you're talking about. I just fave minor disagreements.",removecomment

AutoModerator,Negative Karma Removal,"I think there are positives to testing asyntomatics and weakly-symtomathics group of 
the population and not just individual that are symptomatics. I think it is possible that the lethality of this virus is greatly exagerrated by the bias in the testing process and perhaps a more efficient solutions could had been reach if we had understood the virus better. Say for instance, that the virus is only weakly symptomathic or is asyntomathic in a redicolous number such as 99.9999% of under 40s with no pre-condition. If We could somehow just implement social disnancing measures for over 40s and under 40s with pre-conditions and let the virus go through the rest of the population in 3 or 4 weeks without impacting significantly the health system. This would not only reduce economic damage, but it would allow for greater support of our critical industries and a reduction of the risk of exhusting our critical resources, which is the compunding factor of a pandemic.

Of course, such an approach would require much greater precision, and it would require pre-planned and preantive measures. Stratigacally accelerate the curve for subgroup and desaccelerate it for another group, a feat of social-engenering perhaps beyond of what is possible for country like US. 
But, a fact is that the economic and social damage of this measures taken by the government are also real, and perhaps for some very large subset of the population the remedy is more harmful than the disease.",removecomment

SmokingFrog,remove,"No I am giving the same energy to the Asian Community that the Asian Community gives to Black Americans.
             
again you never seen Black Community as a collective denigrate the Asian community. In fact Foundational Black Americans been their biggest supporters of Asians since the 1970s since they came over in masses. They set up shop in Black Communities. Their movies back in the day were supported by Black Americans.            
               
That level of Support has very been reciprocated by the Asian community. Instead the Asian community feel they are Honorary Whites, and perfectly fine with Racism, when its Black People on the other end of it. You have all these people running around talking about Black People need to go spend money at Asian businesses, yet Asians would never spend a dime in a Black Business even if they next door and have the stuff they need. The Asian Community wouldnt even pee on a Black Person if they were on fire. So stop with that nonsense nonexistent comparison. Black Americans historically treated Asians way better than Asians have ever treated Foundational Black Americans. 
            

            
>Or let's take those anti-semitic murders/attack in New York committed by Black men and women. I saw, sadly, quite a lot of Black people justifying that. That's fucking horrible.

That guy was an Immigrant first of all. He wasnt even a Foundational Black American. Second of all, that guy identified as Jewish, so how is he Anti Semetic?  Only Whites can be Jews now? Again he was mentally ill. Nobody justify that, nor do we claim that guy. On the other hand, Asians in Masses had protest to justify an Asian officer killing an innocent Black Man. Again show me the Black Community doing that. 
           
>Black racism against Asians(which is very common)     

No its not. You clever throwing out a lie and pretending like its equivalent. There are far more cases of Asians attacking Black People. Again you can easily find videos of Asian Shop owners attacking Black Women (one of their main consumer groups BTW). Show me how many White Women get punched and beat up by Asian Men in their Asian Shops.",removecomment
SmokingFrog,remove,you have no idea what you're talking about,removecomment
SmokingFrog,remove,"No the bigger problem there was Asians across the country came out in masses to justify Peter Liang's murder of an unarmed innocent Black Man, using the excuse that White Officers get away with it so Asian cops should to. That was very dehumanizing, and you never seen Black Americans do that kind of thing as a collective to any group. Asians here in the United States have a long rap sheet of Anti Black American culture and behavior as a collective. Yet Foundational Black Americans been their main supporters since mass immigration became a thing in the 1970s. Again if White People came out in masses to support a White cop murdering a innocent Black Man, we would called them White Supremacist/Neo Nazis, Lynch Mobs, you name it. So why is it OK for Asians to do that? Yet they cry about Racism when White Supremacist turn on them? Again, don't cry to us Foundational Black Americans. Fight your own battle. Stop running to us whenever White Supremacist starts attacking them. Because any other time the Asian community seem to as a collective be perfectly fine with White Supremacy when the victim is Black. Again hold your own pair.",removecomment

I can bring up many more articles of Asian shop owners beating up black women, killing black people and even the large Asian protest to support Peter Liang murdering and unarmed innocent black man. If White People did that, they would get called Nazis or Charlottesville neo Nazi Riot. So why should Black People fight for people like that which shit on the very people whose backs are the reason they got over here in masses post Civil Rights Era. Foundational Black Americans are the main supporters of the Asian films and Asian businesses in America from the 70s to the Present. Yet to have a massively disrespectful protest to support a Asian cop killing an innocent unarmed Black Man, is totally racist and out of line, but yet want to cry racism when White Supremacist turn on them. They have to hold their own pair on this. Trump is going to do what he has to do.

AutoModerator,Negative Karma Removal,"Yeah but Kawhi just being there off the ball is such an offensive threat that people can finally recognize why players like him, Durant, Kobe and Jordan are so good, without them you can still have a full offense that will run well. If Harden or LeBron had a bad 4th quarter then the entire team would have done bad because they are the entire offense, they have the ball in their hand all the time and add less off the ball (LeBron because he can’t shoot as well and Harden for some reason chooses not to). Kawhi literally only took 14 shots in 4 fourth quarters COMBINED like you said which is absolutely nothing- even if he missed all those shots they barely hurt the offense because even though he missed most of his shots he barely took any. At least when he’s not shooting the ball, his all star point guard can facilitate and the entire team at least has the chance to ball without him. Imagine a pass first point guard like Lowry playing with LeBron lol he would not have the series he had because he simply wouldn’t get the touches and wouldn’t have the same options when he has the ball in his hand. If Kawhi had that same percentage on more shots then it would be a different story and if they lost. Not to mention when he actually does get the ball, the other team doubled him way more than they do LeBron (but not as much as Harden) so even if he’s not getting the points and assists, he’s changing the shape of the defense in a way that helps him team tremendously. I know everyone won’t share the same opinions but I think it’s a testament to Kawhis greatness that he can take his foot off the brakes and still see his team do well only because I rarely ever see that from high usage guards like LeBron and Harden. 

I’m only talking about LeBron and Harden because you mentioned them not because I hate them but you understand my point.

TL;DR he’s not criticized because Kawhi helps his team win even when he’s not putting up the stats.",removecomment

In the blue corner!  Wearing nothing but shoes, shorts and MMA gloves. We have the reigning, defending, undefeated anti-NBA champion- Rudy ""Touching the microphones because I'm badass"" Gobert !!!

And in the red corner!  Wearing a full plate of armor. It is the challenger! He is fighting for us all, in order to bring the NBA season back. It's Adam ""Looks like an alien child rapist"" Silver !!!

I am just so fed up with this bullshit. Many of those NBA reporters probably want to stay up to date and read r/nba click a link about their work and read the worst crap, written by some embarrassing losers. It's one thing to constructively criticise lacking work or a bad take. But why does Windhorst, who does a lot of great work, get constantly shat on? For what reason in this world do people hate on Shelbourne, MacMullan and Doris Burke? 
I get when people constantly hold a person with real influence or power accountable. Trump for his terrible presidency, Lebron for his Hongkong comments or Mark Cuban for the sexual harrasment scandal within the Mavs organisation. But an online crusade against a reporter who asked a disagreeable question on a shaky premise, really?

It should really take a quantum of empathy to realize why these names should be avoided, especially considering that (a) we already have both other names that have been widely accepted, and (b) I could see Wuhan Coronavirus (though I'd avoid it), but Chinese Virus doesn't even many sense--we don't refer to Ebola by The Congo Virus.

It's quite obvious what Trump is doing. He's trying to distract from his failings by sowing resentment against China. And I'd say M.O. involves primarily sowing racial resentment. That's not surprising, given it's a trick that worked in 2016.

THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER LAWYER FOUND DEAD ON A GOLF COURSE WITH ANOTHER 6 FIGURE CHECK FROM MJ IN HIS POCKET. never heard of anything coming from that

another guy wrote a book with proof that he had won $900,000 from MJ via golf.

his dad was just killed and to this day there is no evidence linking either person in jail to the crime. 

a book written about the whole thing figures the mob killed his dad because him and MJ were doing shady shit that was fucking them out of money. MJ with his gambling and they thought pops was a drug mule.

his dad was convicted of embezzlement right when MJ was drafted into the NBA, as well

I feel like most people think the response has been poor, but [Democrats literally wanted Trump to end the travel ban and thought it was overreaching](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/11/democrat-response-to-coronavirus-end-trumps-travel-bans-on-china-iran/) and [called it racist](https://www.wnd.com/2020/02/democrats-call-trumps-expansion-travel-ban-racist/), while actively trying to resist it. Coronavirus hasn't gotten anywhere as bad as H1N1 yet and I don't think depression-inducing panic is going to solve anything. Neither does appealing to some moral authority and politicizing a topic where, you personally should want good leadership and a calm attitude.

Trump has already tried to appropriately seek funding meanwhile Nancy Pelosi had the United States senate on lock from the middle of January into February, and then again when a coronavirus bill was trying to be passed she tried to sneak in a Hyde amendment exception [source](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/sasse-rips-pelosi-for-trying-to-smuggle-hyde-amendment-loophole-into-coronavirus-package/).

AutoModerator,Negative Karma Removal,"What you guys don't understand is how broke Tillman Fertitta is right now.

Calling him a billionaire is misleading because he's as liquid as tile.

In fact, he's positioned about as poorly as you could be.

All of his primary revenue streams are literally shut down: restaurant, casino, hospitality, basketball.

He's highly leveraged.  He took out high interest loans against his hospitality businesses so he could buy the Rockets.  Les Alexander (former Rockets owner) also personally loaned him $175m to complete the Rockets sale.

And don't forget that he lost a huge Chinese revenue stream right before the season started.

Also, just to add insult to injury, the Thunder were actually better than the Rockets after the Russell Westbrook trade which is a reminder that the Rockets are on the books for mega max deals to Westbrook and Harden.

Tillman strikes me as the kind of guy to not pay in a circumstance like this anyway (if you've seen a few episodes of Billion Dollar Buyer, you get a feel for him) but he probably doesn't have the money to cough up as is.

Think about it - 1) if he's taking out high interest bonds on his primary companies that means his credit wasn't that good to begin with and he was illiquid and 2) he took out a $175m personal loan to complete the sale which means he didn't have that cash lying around.

Tilman is highly leveraged, all of his primary revenue streams have gone to 0 and will stay there for the next 2-3 months, all of his companies have taken a huge haircut in valuation (meaning he sells any right now and probably loses 20% off the top) and he has no cash on hand.

The USA has limited its testing to only those who are seriously ill and have known contact to a previously infected person. But if they haven’t been testing for infected people, then this dumbass attempt at testing based on known personal connections to a sick person has basically crippled any testing results the USA had in the past. Even if they catch up with testing 50k a day from today onwards it’s likely due to the exponential growth nature of the virus that the USA will be significant worse off than skorea and given the fact that Americans of younger ages have more comorbidities due to obesity related health issues, the USA is going to be much much worse off.

Getting a test does nothing for you beyond giving you something to post on twitter about. If you're sick stay home even if its not COVID-19. Testing at this point is only really useful on non-symptomatic people who won't know to quarantine otherwise. But, we can't test hundreds of millions of people every week so that's not ever going to be an option.

AutoModerator,Negative Karma Removal,"So it's more complicated than that, but I don't think the Nets should be blamed.

Basically the United States CDC decided to develop their own test. They did this because they didn't want to rely on the WHO test. Their initial problems generally stemmed from the fact China was refusing to ship virus specimen samples, so we had to get them from someplace else in the early days.

Then they fucked up the first test they created which basically meant they had to design a second one. They also had to throw out about 150,000 testing kits which had them on pace with what the WHO had developed at the time.

The problem is further compounded by the fact that the laboratory testing equipment the CDC and public laboratories have is sometimes different than that in most major research hospitals, which is generally different than that in most regional hospitals, and what is available in private labs is often a mixture. That is why you have different insurance networks in contact with different labs developing their own testing capabilities, so they can insure that their network has access to testing. 

These things take time - it's not really a lack of resources. There is all the money they need and basically every lab that does this sort of thing, both public and private, are working on it.

So it's not just a matter of ""put money into increasing production,"" or ""buying them from abroad."" It's not like there is a plethora of equipment used for RNA extraction of samples just lying around, or a massive untapped manufacturing capability for that sort of specialized equipment.

But the reason I disagree with people casting this as ""rich versus poor"" is that diagnostic criteria for testing people is often going to involve behavior and the number of people that a subject would come into close contact with. Someone like an NBA player is at greater risk than your average Joe because they get swarmed by fans in public, not to mention they are effectively part of a population where n = 450 and public health officials know some of them are infected, so testing that whole population makes sense from a medical perspective.",removecomment

jadenx2,remove,"Westbrick is the most toxic team cancer on the court in NBA history, Ruined Melo's career, he was literally an all star the season before he became a thunder all of a sudden cancerbrick and his stans blamed him for all of OKC's failures. 

Once oladipo got away from him he immediately became an all star and led his team to the same record as trash's team despite trash having a vastly superior team.

PG demanded a trade when he finally realized how badly he fucked up staying with the overrated trash.

KD left the thunder because of trashbrick and him liking (and later unliking) several tweets and posts on twitter/instagram bashing trash several different times is no coincidence, even his brother was bashing him as well. 

There isnt a player that makes star teammates worse than trash and its not even close. How the fuck do you get outplayed by a rookie and lose to a rookie led team that didnt have a single all star in their entire roster in the first round especially when you have 2 HoFers on your team.

If that isnt enough proof to convince you hes a toxic team killing cancer, look at the thunder, immediately got much better the second they traded him, even has a record much better than trash's new team. 

Trash is Lucky the season got suspended, harden was looking to be trash's next victim, and oh boy if they lost to okc in the 1st round, i mean trash's career is already buried with a tombstone, but that would be a cherry on top of his career's coffin.",removecomment

Rockstar408,remove,"In retrospect, when I look back I realize my parents raised me very well. However, when I was a kid, I thought the opposite. My parents gave me so much advice that I started tuning it out. I 100% would've listen to a celebrity I looked up to's social media post more than my parents. Kids on the cusp of puberty and teenagers are simply hardwired to be rebellious, they listen to people who they think are ""cool"" instead of their parents. There are literally countless books, movies, and real anecdotes about kids and teenagers refusing to listen to their parents, about following what the ""cool"" people do, it's just what happens.

You clearly do not have any children over the age of 10 if you think kids not listening to their parents are a result of them not being raised properly. Don't fucking act like you know how to raise a child ""correctly"" when you've never raised one yourself, you pompous ass.

I'm not the only one that disagrees with you, considering how literally every one of your comments in this thread is downvoted to oblivion. Are you actually saying that what famous people say and post don't affect other people?",removecomment

nick168,remove,"> He grew up playing soccer and ice hockey but lived in poverty in the Saint-Michel neighborhood. He dropped out of high school at age 16 and worked as a cook and dishwasher in a St-Hubert restaurant.[3] In 2012, he was offered a spot on a tournament basketball team, and scored 44 points in the tournament final.

It seems that like Giannis, he is a soccer reject who started to play Basketball late in life because he realised that being tall is the most important thing in Basketball and he is very tall.

In 2012 he was 19 years old... He played his first Basketball game at the age of 19. 

So yes, he is in the NBA just because he is very tall.

What a dumb sport.

Then you wonder why Gobert did what he did.... he is an entitled prick who is getting paid millions just for being very tall, like this Boucher dude.",removecomment

AutoModerator,Brigade Protection,"**How do I work?** First I read as many new comments as I can and turn each one into a list of noun phrases (things like 'raindrop' or 'brown paper package'). Next I pluralize them and run them through an algorithm to determine the number of syllables each noun phrase contains. If I find that your comment contains three noun phrases of 2 syllables each, one noun phrase of 5 syllables, and one noun phrase of 6 syllables I simply insert them into the lyrics and post them back to you! Finding noun phrases, determining syllables counts, and pluralizing words are all very tricky and I often make mistakes! But my developer is always tweaking and adding new rules (and exceptions to rules) to make finding your Favorite Things more accurate!

Not at all. There's good reason we don't utilize an overall popular vote, middle America wouldn't have their voices heard. It's just that those markets usually A. Have more people per capita than the vast majority of the country and B. Aren't diverse politically.

In fairness half of the country doesn't vote so we can't for sure say one way or the other.

Biden is now unpopular? The entire party is backing him and he'll be more competitive in the south and blue collar states than Hillary and certainly Bernie. Maybe unpopular amongst Millennials but not in general.",removecomment
