"My point is your eye is not better than a statistical model retard   Since you deleted your comment or something I'll just respond here  >People on this sub using analytics to argue that the Lakers were more efficient without him  >There’s no point did  I watch a game and think they were better without Kobe.  If this is not arguing that your eye is better than statistics I must not know how to read. And to your point about me ""not understanding stats"" or whatever it said, though I'm far from an expert I am an econ major who does a lot of course work in stat and econometrics so I would definitely say I have atleast an intermediate grasp on the subject."	0

I actually did answer his question just in another comment chain right below it. And just for the record you shouldn't brush off what are very clear signs of mental unease in your comments.  A living wage is one in which a person working 40 hours a week can afford all the necessities (shelter, clothing, a phone, health care, etc.) as well as have enough left over at the end of the month for an emergency fund (so that you can actually take a breath that isn't tainted by the pressure of wondering what happens if you miss just one paycheck and maybe not be terrified about your financial situation every waking second).   THAT is a living wage. It will be different depending on the state and even city, and not everyone will be diligent about saving, but what I outlined isn't outrageous or impossible.	0

The Cavaliers should pick him up.  With his consecutive 50 point games he should be a hot commodity.  With him opting out of his contract this year he can essentially choose his own destiny.

Does she have preexisting medical conditions, like 99% of people who were falsely said to have “died from coronavirus” in Italy?  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/99-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-says  The “test” for SARS CoV-2, for those who haven’t figured it out yet, is **admittedly** meaningless, and not connected to illness. A “positive” test reliably [shows up in 8-15% of people tested]( https://youtu.be/p_AyuhbnPOI).  There is no rampant deadly outbreak happening, as I can see from my own experience at an American hospital every day.   Saying someone “dies of coronavirus” or even that they’re “battling coronavirus” is as meaningful and scientific as saying they died of cooties.  https://www.mercurynews.com/coronavirus-false-test-results-with-the-push-to-screen-come-questions-of-accuracy	0

"I dont think anyone who has the choice between a sink w/ soap and hand sanitizer is arguing hand sanitizer does it better. what IS being argued is when sink w/ soap isnt nearby, sanitizer IS a safe and convenient option to use when 60% alc or more. running down halls or to another building or wherever its obviously not convenient is not good advice when you have a reliable method in hand sanitizer.  shitposting up and down saying ""wash your hands!!!!!"" in response to saying hand sanitizer works on a post about hand sanitizer not working is stupid. if its convenient and right there, wash your hands. If its not convenient and you have hand sanitizer, use a healthy amount and youre fine. if anything opening door handles out of the bathroom that carry germs is far more dangerous to risk than hands free squirts from a bottle that can air dry where you sit. no navigating or grabbing of door handles required at your desk or whatever. neither option is bad, but going out of your way to find a sink w/soap because you refuse hand sanitizer is retarded."	0

I honestly think some of them care a lot about fans, but the majority don't give a fuck. I got to meet Kobe Bryant IRL and he couldn't have been cooler to everyone there.

The part where you wrote 'his child isn't transitioning' does make it clear, though. Using different pronouns and a different name is absolutely one part of transitioning (though it doesn't necessarily *have* to be), and transitioning does not imply only changes that involve medical or surgical procedures. She's changed her preferred name and asked that she/her be used for her pronouns.  I get where the other reply is coming from, it's not that you're being particularly offensive here but cis people speaking up about what is/isn't appropriate/complicated/acceptable for trans people can be a real sore spot when the opinions of actual trans people are actively being disregarded.	1

I think there are positives to testing asyntomatics and weakly-symtomathics group of  the population and not just individual that are symptomatics. I think it is possible that the lethality of this virus is greatly exagerrated by the bias in the testing process and perhaps a more efficient solutions could had been reach if we had understood the virus better. Say for instance, that the virus is only weakly symptomathic or is asyntomathic in a redicolous number such as 99.9999% of under 40s with no pre-condition. If We could somehow just implement social disnancing measures for over 40s and under 40s with pre-conditions and let the virus go through the rest of the population in 3 or 4 weeks without impacting significantly the health system. This would not only reduce economic damage, but it would allow for greater support of our critical industries and a reduction of the risk of exhusting our critical resources, which is the compunding factor of a pandemic.  Of course, such an approach would require much greater precision, and it would require pre-planned and preantive measures. Stratigacally accelerate the curve for subgroup and desaccelerate it for another group, a feat of social-engenering perhaps beyond of what is possible for country like US.  But, a fact is that the economic and social damage of this measures taken by the government are also real, and perhaps for some very large subset of the population the remedy is more harmful than the disease.	0
From what I understand, Lebron went to Miami to gain championship experience and he wanted a change from the shitty front office of the Cavs. He went back purely for his promise to win a championship for his home team, so I think he still would have returned regardless of which team he chose in 2010	0
A 3% population cull that utterly grinds the world economy to a halt is pretty much the most retarded population control idea ever.  It's just a virus bred from filthy wet-market conditions and awful animal selection for meat in China, and has been handled with near complete incompetence by the CCP until it was too late and spread to the rest of the world...where it is now being handled with complete incompetency by the US govt among others.	0
"This is exactly what I'm talking about.   People think the accusations were disproved or that there was some sort of disagreement over the evidence.  Why exactly is unclear.  The only time Kobe challenged any of the factual accusations was when he thought he could make it go away by lying to the police when he was first arrested.   Rose confirmed every single piece of evidence brought up to him in the case.   All the Rose case proves is that its basically impossible to get a date rapist convicted in a criminal court because you can't prove mens rea even when you get the rapist to admit to it.  All they have to say is ""I thought she consented,"" regardless of whether there is a textbook's worth of evidence that she did not."	0

They even got back in touch a few years back after he figured out social media. They send each other family photos, swap work stories (they are all retired) and occasionally even skype on holidays. Last thanksgiving, I was over at my dad's and Josh was visiting while they were skyping. His mom knows from my dad that I'm a huge baseball fan and she offered to introduce us. Well, Josh would have none of it. First he pretended to not hear her while she awkwardly made excuses for him that he was busy preparing the turkey in the kitchen (we could see him right behind her coloring with crayons or some shit), but then he rolled his eyes and said ""for fuck's sake"" loud enough for us to hear. He finally came over into full view and I shit you not, was wearing a bib and holding massive turkey legs in each of his hands. He didn't say a goddamn word. No hello or hi or even a smile. He just looked into the camera with dead eyes and just sucked the meat right off the turkey bones, one at a time, like a little kid sucking jelly off his fingers. Fucking Beckett."""	0

The record and the championships don't say much. UCLA had won two consecutive championships before Kareem and then went on to win four straight the second he left. They were a ridiculously dominant team regardless of him and won multiple championships and rarely lost games without him.  Kareem is in the conversation, but to act like he is undeniably the GOAT is plain absurd... Go look at what Bird did in his three years at Indiana fucking State and you will understand why. Bill Walton also has a legitimate claim as the college basketball GOAT and so has Oscar Robertson.  So yeah, saying that calling anyone besides Kareem the GOAT is ridiculous actually is absolutely retarded.	0

he was getting fucked by the refs and went passive aggressive but it's also proof that those heat teams weren't shit without him. wade was still elite, bosh was never elite and was a solid #3 in most facets of the game but nobody else was gonna carry that team  his FT rate dropped more from the rest of the playoffs to the finals than anyone else you'll find on basketball-reference.com. he took the most shots in the restricted area in the whole series too. dirk got more FTA on jumpers than lebron did on drives  i firmly believe that lebron paid the price for wade's first title where he got 100 FTA and they fucked the mavs  the narrative was that the heat were the bad guys all season and if you think billion dollar leagues don't think about narratives, then who am i to tell you the tooth fairy isn't real either	0

I see what you're saying. On the face of it, all of Kobe's awards look one-sided vs Hakeem's individual awards.   Context matters, though: one year, the dream pulled a Dirk before Dirk, meaning he won with only role players. The next, his best teammate was acquired by a mid-season trade that saw the former 2nd best quit on the team (Maxwell) during the playoffs, and Drexel was then at the end of his peak years.  On the other hand, I think it matters significantly that Kobe played with prime Shaq, then had the freakishly skilful, long bois in Pau (arguably the most one-sided trade in history at the time), Bynum, and Odom.  Long story short, Hakeem did waaaay more carrying that Kobe ever had to, and that elevates him above Kobe in my admittedly biased opinion. If just looking at accolades, I think he joins Jordan and Kawhi as the first to win MVP, FMVP, and DPOY the same year. And one year he should have won over Robinson, was robbed, then took it very personally in their playoff match up. People forget he's top 10 in steals and number one in blocks, so arguably the most unique and versatile defender the game has seen as well.  That's my case, but it's a debate.	0

We use European tests. Government won’t buy them/let us use them because they’re foreign and therefore not CDC approved. They’ve been proven to work effectively in South Korea, China, and Italy though, so there’s no real reason we haven’t started using them yet...  ...other than a particular group of people wanting to keep infection numbers down because of how those numbers may reflect on them in a particularly important year. That’s just my opinion though, it’s neither here nor there.	1
I feel like you are missing the point Jeremy Lin was trying to make. Blaming China does not alleviate the issue that USA failed to properly respond to the situation. Banning flights was supposed to give the US time to prepare for the epidemic, but they failed miserably. The virus does not care about race. It does not care about politics, sex, religion, or whatever. It cares about 1 thing. The human race. And as humans, we need to come together.   >It doesn’t have to be flashy or heroic. Choosing light could just be checking on a friend who is mentally struggling. It could be showing extra appreciation for your delivery person or standing up for someone who is being bullied. Sharing positivity or supporting your favorite local bookstore or restaurant during this hard time. It could even just be honoring a lockdown or stopping yourself from posting a hateful comment online.  >The road ahead won’t be easy. There will be times when it feels like the darkness is too much. Each day when the death tolls climb, when the unemployment rates continue to surge, when the next news story of a hate crime breaks, it might feel as if the negativity is insurmountable.  >But please, if you’re feeling hopeless, even right now, remember you’re not alone in this. We will grieve together, we will adapt together, and eventually we will thrive together. At the end of all this, we will take a long look in the mirror, and we won’t be able to lie to ourselves about how we acted.   >I believe we’ll be proud of what we see.   >Each act of goodness matters. Each positive choice will add up.  >In adversity, we will persevere. In challenges, we will overcome. In fear, we will have faith. And in darkness, we will be Light.	0

5G! they found that 60gigahertz mm waves cause oxygen atoms to oscelate and throws the spin off axis. the hemoglobin in our blood cant attach to the oxygen in our lungs to deliver the the rest of our body. electroporation (spelling) is a new method of infecting our healthy cells with toxins (environmental and vaccines) the effects of 5G can mimic the symptoms of this supposed virus.

Think for a second. Maybe it was Brunson ( who charged recklessly into Dedmon ) that was playing overly aggressive? That’s like a running back charging into a linebacker and complaining about getting hurt. Literally all Brunson had to do was play smart, realize it’s the FIRST possession of the game and not try to draw reckless body fouls like it’s the Finals. Our team has sucked for two years bud. We’ve been in playoffs 10 straight years before that and had the best record in the league. Want to know what happened that year? Matthew Della fucking dova dove at Kyle Korvers knees taking him out for the playoffs. Want to know what happened next?! A NO CALL! At least Brunson got the fucking call lmao!!

Nah, they can't defend. Draymond is past his best plus Klay gets beat on back cuts all day. As good as Steph is he won't be enough to carry the other bums - not including Klay as a bum as he can clearly defend when he isn't snoozing and gets hot like no other.	1

Are you asking how to explain it biologically? Cause basically what happens is you start in the womb with two X chromosomes. We all start out female. Then at a certain point in the development we go through a certain process where ducts open and certain hormones are released. Testosterone if you are a boy, estrogen (i think or it might be a different hormone) if you are a girl   But sometimes there are issues with the transformation. And a defect is created where there is an imbalance in the brain biology and body biology leading to an lgbtq person. So yes a gay person is biologically gay. It's just a defect of their body attempting to fit into the male or female role  Ps for anyone who is going to downvote me for explaining this you should know I have actually studied this so if you haven't actually studied this then you can't anger down vote me	1

> The Grizzlies made it known what their asking price for Evans was (a first round pick), and various teams around the league decided not to give the Grizzlies what they wanted. Wallace decided it was in the team’s best interest to keep Tyreke in hopes of re-signing him this summer. Wallace was definitely stubborn in his approach, **demanding a first round pick and not accepting some of the rumored alternative deals.**  That’s the key part there. Teams were still willing to give up *something* for Evans, just not a first rounder. Either way, it’s a very different situation than a player potentially getting bought out.  By the way, I understand you’re a Lakers fan and expect things to get handed to you just because, but you’re not getting Iggy for free, end of story.	1

AI averaged 36 PPG in the finals against a Lakers team that swept everyone in the West. Iverson was supposed to get swept too but he made a statement in game 1 by carrying the 76ers top a win with 50 points. Curry only averaged 30 PPG last finals because pf his 47 point outlier, and he only got 47 points because Raptors were up 20 points the whole game so the defense was more relaxed. Every other finals he averaged 21-26 PPG on like 40% FG, there's a reason why he never won Finals MVP. Curry never scored when it mattered, he basically got trash points. Even the last finals when he averaged 30 PPG, Klay was the MVP as he was scoring with efficiency and scored to keep the game close. Curry was shooting them out of the games and then scored when GS was already up, thanks to Klay. Curry had that great 47 point game, but like I said, as great as that performance was, they were never a threat to get the game close so they were basically empty stats. Curry also has other players to take the pressure off of scoring from him and he still is inefficient and can't score when he's called to do it. You're trying to say Iverson never played the level of performance that Steph did in the finals? You're correct, because he was at a different level than Steph. Iverson was the only option and still scored on the Lakers, and that's with Shaq protecting the paint. You're so retarded it's hilarious. Bullshit nostalgia? Nah use your eyes and watch the game. Call a spade a spade when you see it, and the spade is that Curry can't score at will, Iverson can. That's why AI averaged 36 PPG in the finals, more than what Curry has averaged in FIVE finals appearances. That's why AI averaged 28-34 PPG in the regular season even though he was the only option to score and make plays during his prime. In terms of scoring, AI is better than Curry.	0

"Attention ""why is it racist LOL?"" idiots: no one reasonable disputes where this comes from. China is guilty of really shitty things, including trying to cover up this virus to begin with, and I would never defend them in a thousand years.  But this Lin quote isn't about about their corrupt gov't. It's about actual Asian people, especially those living in the US, who are now the target of violent hate crimes across the country despite having nothing to do with the virus or China.  Brown people got similar treatment post-9/11, we should be better than that as a society 19 years later.

Can't believe no one talks about this dude Rik Smits he's legit just like Porzy, he got Shaq into foul trouble and when people say can Shaq play in today's game they should look at his matchups against this guy cuz he basically got pulled out from the paint guarding Smits and Reggie kept driving and finishing.

Exactly. He had blinders on as a competitor and that can result in being an asshole to even teammates.

Malone stuck with his team until he was 40.  Durant bailed when he was 28 and joined the best team in the league.  If Durant hadn't have bailed he'd most likely have 0 rings.  If 28 year old Malone had joined the best team in the league he'd have like 6 rings.	0

"> You dont get to decide what someones intent is   Intent doesn't particularly matter in the context of this discussion. I could mistakenly believe that ""faggot"" was a nice term and go around calling my gay friends giant faggots and still be a dumb asshole. Language is collectively determined. The world homo is generally offensive to gay people. If you don't want to be rude to gay people, don't say it. End of discussion.    You can be edgy or offensive for laughs if you want. I certainly am, though not too often regarding homosexuality. But don't throw a fit when someone comes along and points out that it's kind of shitty (even if they can't articulate exactly why all that well).  *edit* I should add, I've known quite a few gay people throughout my life, some of them very close friends, and few of them would be particularly hurt or outraged by hearing ""no homo."" Most likely they would roll their eyes or laugh, depending on the context and who is saying it. They have some of the thickest skin of anyone I've met (not surprising, really). That doesn't mean that if they heard someone who wasn't a friend make this and similar jokes loudly and obnoxiously, they wouldn't step up and tell them to knock it the fuck off as a matter of principle."	1

Not to take away from Jaemal’s embarrassment because I know firsthand how it feels but this really throws back to the time my fucking sister posted our video on her finsta.  I didn’t even wanna go to school the next day cuz everyone already knew (we were 2 grades apart, she was a junior and i was a freshmen)  Prayers go out to Jaemal for this. Shit is embarrassing af and it’s honestly the worst feeling. I’m probably gonna reach out to him to let him know he’s not alone  All in all, let’s respect this man’s mistake and move on from this. It’s extremely embarrassing for your videos to go on public by accident and I really wouldn’t wish it on anyone— celebrity or not and hung or not. Jarmal Murray is a great basketball player and I hope he can be remembered as that rather than someone who’s sex tapes were leaked. It’s actually incredibly embarrassing for the girl as she is facing embarrassment because of the fuckup of another person, in my scenario i can relate to his girl because my sister somehow posted our video because she’s a dumb bitch.	0

AI averaged 36 PPG in the finals against a Lakers team that swept everyone in the West. Iverson was supposed to get swept too but he made a statement in game 1 by carrying the 76ers top a win with 50 points. Curry only averaged 30 PPG last finals because pf his 47 point outlier, and he only got 47 points because Raptors were up 20 points the whole game so the defense was more relaxed. Every other finals he averaged 21-26 PPG on like 40% FG, there's a reason why he never won Finals MVP. Curry never scored when it mattered, he basically got trash points. Even the last finals when he averaged 30 PPG, Klay was the MVP as he was scoring with efficiency and scored to keep the game close. Curry was shooting them out of the games and then scored when GS was already up, thanks to Klay. Curry had that great 47 point game, but like I said, as great as that performance was, they were never a threat to get the game close so they were basically empty stats. Curry also has other players to take the pressure off of scoring from him and he still is inefficient and can't score when he's called to do it. You're trying to say Iverson never played the level of performance that Steph did in the finals? You're correct, because he was at a different level than Steph. Iverson was the only option and still scored on the Lakers, and that's with Shaq protecting the paint. You're so retarded it's hilarious. Bullshit nostalgia? Nah use your eyes and watch the game. Call a spade a spade when you see it, and the spade is that Curry can't score at will, Iverson can. That's why AI averaged 36 PPG in the finals, more than what Curry has averaged in FIVE finals appearances. That's why AI averaged 28-34 PPG in the regular season even though he was the only option to score and make plays during his prime. In terms of scoring, AI is better than Curry.	0

Literally every insult you aim at bron fans get be applied to you with curry.   I like bron, but I wasn't cheering for him when he faced my team. I started watching ball a decade ago because of bron so that's why I'm a fan of his. But his success doesn't mean shit for my city. People like you don't understand that.

This is classic Kyrie though... and it's the side of Kyrie that hasn't gotten any attention by the media or the fans at large.   Kyrie doesn't just go after his teammates. He throws them under the bus when **he** has a bad game.    [Here's part of one of my older comments:](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/e2sdk3/kyrie_has_some_choice_words_for_celtics_fans/f8xmk1x/)  ***  Kyrie spent the last season trashing the people around him every time he had a bad game. r/nba needs to go back and watch those games where he was lashing out. Pretty much every single time he spoke negatively about his team was when he was the one having a bad game.  Take the Charlotte game in March. We had a 10 point lead in the fourth before Kyrie subbed in.    * Here's Kyrie going 1/5 in the final quarter ([1](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=594&Season=2018-19&title=MISS%20Irving%2030%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&sct=plot), [2](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=625&Season=2018-19&title=Irving%202%27%20Driving%20Layup%20\(31%20PTS\)&sct=plot), [3](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=627&Season=2018-19&title=MISS%20Irving%2028%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&sct=plot), [4](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=632&Season=2018-19&title=MISS%20Irving%2026%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&sct=plot), [5](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=666&Season=2018-19&title=MISS%20Irving%2026%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&sct=plot)) * Here he is with the turnover, 0 assists for the quarter btw ([1](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=639&Season=2018-19&title=Irving%20Lost%20Ball%20Turnover%20\(P3.T11\)&sct=plot)) * Here he is just ball-watching and oblivious to where his man is ([1](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=586&Season=2018-19&title=MISS%20Walker%2010%27%20Fadeaway%20Jumper&sct=plot), [2](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=624&Season=2018-19&title=Walker%202%27%20Driving%20Layup%20\(29%20PTS\)&sct=plot)) * Here he is not making the effort to contest Kemba's shot ([1](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=576&Season=2018-19&title=MISS%20Walker%2026%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&sct=plot), [2](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=612&Season=2018-19&title=Walker%2026%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot%20\(27%20PTS\)&sct=plot)) * Here's Kyrie's fouls, mostly from playing lazy and not being in position ([1](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=600&Season=2018-19&title=Irving%20L.B.FOUL%20\(P2.T3\)%20\(M.Callahan\)&sct=plot), [2](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=634&Season=2018-19&title=Irving%20P.FOUL%20\(P3.T4\)%20\(B.Taylor\)&sct=plot), [3](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=641&Season=2018-19&title=Irving%20S.FOUL%20\(P4.PN\)%20\(M.Callahan\)&sct=plot), [4](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&GameID=0021801087&GameEventID=657&Season=2018-19&title=Irving%20P.FOUL%20\(P5.PN\)%20\(B.Taylor\)&sct=plot))   And that's all in just the 4th quarter...   Guess what he had to say to the media afterward:  > “The game was over in the beginning of the fourth quarter,” Irving told reporters. “We took our foot off the gas pedal; it got to a five-point game, momentum shifted from there.” >  > He was then asked what does the team talk about following a game like this, one in which the Celtics had an 18-point lead in the fourth quarter only to allow the Hornets to close out the game with a 30-5 run.  >  > “Being more mature down the stretch,” Irving said.  >  > ... >  > “Judge us when we have our full lineup,” Irving said. “But obviously when we come out and play like this with a bunch of young guys down the stretch, figuring things out … things are bound to happen but there’s no excuses.”  ***  This isn't about Jarrett Allen at all.   This is about Kyrie looking for a scapegoat after he went 6/21 (14 points) and had a -29 (worse than all teammates combined) for the night.   The media might not pick up on this, but make no mistake, the guys in the locker room will.	1

Unpopular opinion (even though he publicly announced his affiliation with slytherin) Kobe Bryant is absolutely a gryffindor - he’s loyal and selfish (both traits of Harry) - he just wants to win, he doesn’t complain about not winning MVPs (like lebron) - he wants to be a great player whatever that means (like Harry)  - he isn’t obsessed with his narrative or how people view him (like harry) - he’s the black Mamba, a snake, that’s the only solid reason for slytherin (he feuded with Shaq and for actually reasonable reasons) that pairing is like if Harry’s sidekick had to be George or Fred	0
bro these people are retarded europeans are racist as fuck esp soccer fans. i mean bulgarian fans already have two incidents of mocking black players from the uk within the last two years. im not saying the us isn’t racist but people seriously downplay how racist other countries are (and other races) try being black in china or japan or any asian dominant area, you’re gonna get stares and some people will be afraid of u  off topic but mexicans are also racist as fuck towards black ppl. i worked as a dispatcher for a plumbing company when i was younger and a lot of the guys who did things like excavation were illegals and those dudes were racist as fuck. always calling the black dudes they worked with dumb monkeys or some shit in spanish lol it was pretty wild	0
I don't need to or care to dig up statistics for you as 1) I actually watch almost all the Rockets games so I actually know what I am talking about and 2) I really don't care about your opinion enough to spend the effort.

He scores less on worse effeciency. Don’t be dumb.

I'd take prime Kawhi over a prime Wade.     From 2004-2010, during Wade's prime solo years before the Big 3, the Miami Heat averaged 43 wins a season.      Granted Wade missed about 30 and 20 games two of those seasons, but the Heat really should have a better average record than 43-39.  &#x200B;  Kawhi somehow has that X-factor that translates to championship contender, in his unassuming manner. Spurs were up by 20 against the Warriors because Zaza-pacheapshot. Raptors won a championship, and Clips are in contention too now.	0

Yep see that’s the problem with Reddit. You’re all on here pleasuring each other and looking for acceptance and illogically expect the same from everyone else; fantasizing about the world being peaceful and kind when it’s not absolute like that. I’m free to say whatever I want even if it doesn’t live up to your expectation. Redditors like you think you’ve got everything and everyone figured out and that everyone lives by your soft, majority-rule, social standards. And your only defense mechanism is flipping the script and pointing out “irony” so a bunch of faceless geeks back you up. Congratulations. But your problem is I, on the other hand, do not give a fuck about any of you or what any of you think. So I am content with coming off as douchey, immature, or whatever. It’s a risk I’ll take to possibly stop seeing stupid garbage like this pussy live stream. Call it arrogance, cockiness, confidence, judgy, or whatever. If I wanna call you a pussy then I will and it doesn’t matter what age I am. You’re a pussy, and all of you people are pussies! End of story. Fuck you gonna do about it. I see no irony. But glad it’s entertaining for you and you have more content to fuel a circle jerk with everyone on here. Bc all I really see is a bunch of butthurt Redditors that didn’t get accepted by 100% of the site users and their safespace got invaded against their best wishes. Go fuck yourself nerd and save the lecture for someone that gives a fuck.	0

Absolutely. A lot of the top 8th graders in the country are much bigger than most full grown adults. There are 8th graders at like 6’5. Not to mention it’s not like being bigger is that big an advantage over skill. If you have absolutely no skill you’re not dribbling, shooting, passing, or defending with any sort of efficacy. The adults would get crushed	0

Every single time he touches the ball you foul him.  There is no way a player of his size would be able to shoot even 25% from the line.     You can't have less than five people on the court so you just save your five best players to foul out last.  Hagrid is also way too large and slow to be able to play both defense and offense so either way you are playing 5v4 on one side of the court	0

I would pick Curry if there is another more than average player. Because Curry can't contest the targeted defense since I think 2018. Also I would pick Curry if there are enough great defenders.  I would pick CP3 to lead the younger team, less disciplined team. I would pick CP3 because I don't have an offense system and I don't have an alphamale status as a coach.  Both are great but situational choices.	0

I just have to go on a quick rant about how dumb and gullible NBA fans are. So I saw people bring this back up several times last night cuz of the game that was played on ESPN last night. If you truly believe Green called KD in the parking lot and begged for him to join, not only are you a fkn retard but you are very gullible. If you just think to yourself for 30 seconds, the story makes zero sense. How would the media find out about this cuz I highly doubt Green nor KD would tell a media member and I highly doubt a teammate would snitch on Green. That whole story was made up to create drama and a storyline and you gullible sheep believed it. Just like you believe everything the media says even tho 99% of it is fake news. The NBA media has the fans on strings since they are a bunch of clueless and very gullible puppets	0

He was 25 years old averaging 4 and 4. * Waiving Spencer Dinwiddie in favor of Michael Carter-Williams * Trading Tony Snell for Michael Carter-Williams * Letting Spencer Dinwiddie walk in favor of MCW * John Paxson choking Vinny Del Negro (His own hire), he would later be quoted ""What also disappointed me was that VDN never owned up to making a mistake"" * Fired Scott Skiles on Christmas Eve * Fired Bill Cartwright days after Thanksgiving after giving him mismatched rosters and under-preforming * Overruling This lobbying for Draymond Green to draft Marquis Teague * Refused or failed to take back salary and gather assets preferring to bet on player Development in Jabari Parker & Otto Porter JR * Tyrus Tomas for LaMarcus Aldridge * The biggest free agent signing of their tenure they almost immediately started drama with telling him he was no longer allowed to wear a headband. This policy would appear to be reverted years later w/ no explanation * Interviewed no one for the job of Head Coach but Jim Boylen & hired him. Worse several reporters (For example Vinny Goodwill) have alleged that this was like to have been planned since the summer beforehand. * Blindsided Hoiberg by firing him after showing up expecting to run practice. During his tenure here they fed him a steady stream of their personal projects & mandated them to receive playing time. None of these projects worked out. Examples are Jerian Grant, Cameron Payne, Joffrey Lavergne, Zipser, Felicio, etc. * Leaked that Derrick Rose was healthy to the media putting a ton of pressure on him to return in time for the playoffs & launching a wave of jokes that never really let up * Let Ron Adams go from Thibs Staff angering him & resulting in him going on to be the architect of the Warriors championship defense. He now has 3 rings. * Not trading Pau Gasol in 2015-16 where we would miss the playoffs and he would walk for nothing * Ran such a sloppy situation around Thibs firing that word reached Thibodeau Hoiberg would be his likely replacement while he was still coaching the team. Also serious speculation that this was told to players, undermining his authority as coach. * Thibs even being hired is a win for them right? No, they actually didn't want him. Tom Thibodeau was the recommendation of an outside group hired by Reinsdorf. John Paxson wanted Doug Collins and Gar Forman wanted Mike Brown. * Refused to hire Thibs strength & conditioning coach (Anthony Falsone) in Houston. He would later be hired and win the championship with the San Antonio Spurs in 2013-14. He still serves as their athletic director today. * Escorted Thibs out with security when he was fired. * Overpaid Fred Hoiberg 5 years /25 million and then fired him before it was complete. K.C. Johnson has speculated this is the reason why Jim Boylen remains. As, they don’t want to be paying two coaches not coaching at the same time. * Letting a lot of talent walk for nothing. To avoid the headache of having to defend each and every player in this group I’ll make my case for the best and attach the rest as honorable mentions. Omer Asik is the biggest mistake. We had no backup 5 to replace him and Houston ended up getting an almost lottery pick for him later on so he was definitely moveable if we ever wanted out. Honorable mentions: Deng, Marco, E’Twaun, the Bench mob. * Amnestied Carlos Boozer way too late to be able to matter * Leaked that Kris Dunn apparently wasn’t working hard enough over the summer * Failed to see the writing on the wall and instead of rebuilding committed us to that meaningless three alphas year just to do the same thing in the end. * The entire Doug McDermott situation can be made into like eight bullets and is stupidly controversial among Bulls fans. But I know there will be stans in the comments so I will let them defend Garpax. * Trading 17 & 18 for 11 in the 2013 draft  \*Using #11 to draft Doug Mcderrmott in a good draft.  * Dumping Doug Mcderrmott just two years later for basically nothing. * Were incredibly late to the game of analytics, frequently downplaying its importance. * Kevin O’ Connor speculates that their promising to draft Chandler Hutchison restricted us from doing any draft night trades involving the #22 pick in 2018. Started our rebuild by selling a second- round pick. (We know Jordan Bell isn’t good, that’s never what this was about) * Third largest market in the NBA, paid the luxury tax twice. Traded for OPJ whose making 27 million and has played in 24/78 games available. If his girlfriend is reliable he’s also not a fan of the front office and a free agent in a year. * Horrible medical team. We’re always injured every single year. * Rosters frequently have big holes and they take bizarre steps to fix them. No Small Forward? Jabari. Need a long-term scoring option next to Rose? 33-year-old Rip Hamilton seems like a safe bet. (I love Rip but that doesn’t make it a good signing) Need a solid starting ball-handler & playmaker? Tomas Satorasnky, MCW, Jerian, Rondo seems like the wait maybe nvm. I know that you can’t nail every signing and not even all of these are bad. It’s more that there seems to be consistent gaps between how they evaluate talent & fit and that actually translates to the court. * 5 Playoff Series wins total in a 17-year tenure. * Had a Bulls doctor question Luol Deng about sitting out of games for a broken leg. * Dumped John Salmons and a first & second round pick to chase Lebron and ended up with nothing. * Trading Kirk Hinrich during his farewell tour for basically nothing. * Again, overruling Thibs when he liked Rudy Gobert for Tony Snell * Pulled the QO on David Nwaba for Jabari Parker. I feel like Nwaba while maybe not fantastic on his own fit really well with us. We’ve been a worse team since he left. * Misused Lauri basically his entire time here. Maybe not directly because of this but it’s now being rumored that he wants out. * Traded Taj Gibson in a year we made the playoffs for Cameron Payne & Joffrey Lavergne. * Failing to net any assets at the 2020 trade deadline. * IMO have had serious questions regarding their drafting ability since now Orlando Magic assistant GM left in 2012. * Are alleged to use the media to trash players and coaches by [Van Gundy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I4Y4VyDqrs)  ETA: - Dwade contract  * Couldn't build around Jimmy * Bad player development, everyone is regressing save Zach * Had coaches spy on coaches/players (Randy Brown) * Failed to make Chicago a FA destination * Inherited the prestige Jordan gave us, made us a joke. * Threatening to give Jimmy Butlers minutes to Tony Snell when he refused a contract extension."	0

Advanced stats (Especially Metrics based on PBP data like PIPM/Raptor/RAPM) don’t entirely Measure True Impact or True creation . They have collinearity issues, they Don’t filter for schemes, roster construction & fit.   What Creation and/or impact metrics tells us is  actually “Philadelphia is 3 points per 48 minutes better than the opposing lineups in stints that included Tobias Harris.” Unfortunately, we do not have an unlimited parentheses unfortunately, we do not have an unlimited amount of Trials to test out every possible lineup featuring Harris.This means that we cannot know how much of the three point differential is attributable to Harris. We also will not be able to tell us how those lineups would perform without harass against the same opponent lineups.  What we can do is use a prior to represent what we believe a player’s impact to have been with other lineups in other seasons. This allows us to correct outliers among low minute players, but does not tell us any more about what has happened in the season under consideration   Also, Curry’s creation for me is in line with Kawhi/KD but below Harden/ LeBron.    He’s not really a a great passer imo. A guy like Durant creates Far better off the dribble. On any randomized Possession, KD will take his man off the dribble & find the open man far better than Curry will. with Curry the ball ends up in draymond’s hands a lot once he Can’t establish separation on his defender. He doesn’t have great vision where he's making elite creation plays (passes) where there aren't seemingly points. He's 2nd or 3rd on the team in assists every year despite being 1st in USG% & touches (yes, even more than KD  Curry also plays with Statistically the best passing team in NBA history. When Warriors run 2 or 3 screens for him & he gets trapped, Warriors zip it around the court with incredible accuracy and Vision. Guys like Livingston, Iggy, Dray are very High IQ, they are also able to find Steph offball with ease.  If Steph played on a standard NBA team, with average passers, Low Iq players, An average coach, decent defensive talent, the offense would drop off heavily.  I think majority of NBA fans Believe Durant to be better because It’s incredibly easy to build a contender around him. Just surround him with A lowry/Rubio type, and A few rebounders & you’re in contention.   He masks a lot of weaknesses  Bc he’s so versatile on both sides of the ball, he plays 4 positions on offense and 3-4 on defense.  With Steph, You need much more. An elaborate screening scheme (warriors run most of off ball screens per game), Very good coaching & play calling, A Playmaking 4 that’s operated in space (Draymond) & You always have to have Elite POA defenders.   There’s just very little repeatability with Steph on a randomized set of teammates than W/ a KD or LeBron for example. I roll with Durant for these reasons but I’m not totally Against Curry, especially if you have An insane foundation already. I didn’t mean to sound condescending if I come off that way.	0

Lebrons teammates screwed him SO HARD at the end of that game. Here’s the final play made by every starter besides Lebron.  Kevin Love - On the play before the Hill free throws the Cavs are winning by 2. Kevin Love makes one of the most disgusting soft fouls ever. Probably the worst foul committed in the history of the Cavs franchise, given what it meant. Steph gets an EASY and 1 to put them up by 1. This foul was literally just as bad as the Ginobili v Dirk foul but nobody remembers it because of what else happened.  George Hill - next play Hill misses the FT. Now I’m not too mad about this because that’s fucking hard to do, making both free throws in that situation. Idc if it’s MJ, KD, Dirk, or anyone in between. Hitting free throws at the end of a finals game is Not easy. That being said he’s still an 80% FT shooter who missed.  JR Smith - didn’t know the score of the game somehow,, and then lied about it, also tried to point the finger at Lebron.  Tristan - tried to start a fight with Draymond  If Lebron didn’t know he was leaving,he knew after that. Literally every starter besides him did something retarded to end that game.	0

It was my senior year of high school basketball. It was a David Vs Goliath game. We were playing a highly ranked team in the equivalent of our playoffs. We were significantly smaller and had been blown out by them earlier in the season.   Anyways, there was 1.4 on clock and we were down 1. We called a time out and we decided to run the exact same inbound play we had been running the whole game. They had been leaving the short baseline open all game, and we figured they would likely pack the paint. It worked to perfection. We hit the buzzer beater and our entire team ran onto the court. It was a good a day.	0

Don't underestimate the power of a little help on the hip or shoulder, and definitely don't underestimate the official's decision and why he called it. These guys are good, and that hip shove is exactly why the foul was called. It destroys your balance, and jump shooting is mostly about about balance and rhythm.

If LeBron handpicked his teammates he could have picked a hell of a lot better ones. He could’ve joined much better teams than the lakers.   LeBron doesn’t have full control over who gets signed. That’s absurd. He has input sure, but he’s not hand picking who is signed or who teams draft.   And if my aunt had a dick she would be my uncle. Players make fucking shots. That happens. LeBron scored 16 that quarter btw. Which you ignorant fools like to ignore.   Sure let’s say the cavs lose in 2016. Give me all of my hypotheticals and LeBron has a hell of a lot more than 3 rings.   Ray Allen is a hypothetical because he didn’t miss.   I never mentioned 2011 as that is obviously a stain on his legacy.   No one is removing him of blame you numb nuts. We just actually have a brain and use it to provide context.	1

Based on what. In the first month of the season KD is averaging 27ppg on 68.1 TS% and Curry 26ppg on 65.7 TS%. Curry has a greater playmaking load than Durant and was still the centerpiece of their offball actions that the foundation of their offense is built upon.  It was very much so a 1A, 1B partnership. Lots of debates of who was the best player on the team with no decisive answer.	0

I don't get why people think guy is some lowkey douche. I remember watching a player tribune video and guy seemed like a very well-spoken and geniune dude. Maybe he has faults and could seem immature but it doesn't seem he is some POS person. It's why I laugh at the arrogant Jimmy Butler fanboys thinking KAT is not some good hearted person. I really feel bad for his loss man.  I'm done with people being entitled in America. It's not just about taking things seriosuly but just understnading the situation. Many people complain about how much these lockdowns are hurting many people and I aree. We can't expect to lockdown America for so long, but we need to get people hve already and can be affected by this and it's not good. It's why I wish people just stopped panicking like the babies in r/coronovirus making everything seemed like the end of the world and people at /unpopularopinion saying this virus is a joke and that everything should cater ot people who won't bve affected and going to malllies and getting dollies for my baby girl is more important.    That's to any conservativesliving in POS joke states like Alabmama, Florida, Texas, and whatever white KK hotspots GO FUCK YOURSELF. This applies to you baby insecure SJWs living in California. If oyu don't like republicnas or democrats just don't ever go these states or care about them. I'm never going to shitty states that have KKK activity like georgia or North Carolina cause I know there will be some sort of racism so I don't give a fuck.   I don't care if KAT is a celebrity, his mother fuckin died and seemed like a average American. Fuck America at times. Hope people just take things seriosuly and just look towards getting things done SOON. We could possibly get this under control, we should always have faith. The season can literally restart in 2020. But just do THINGS NOW. Americans are super entitled and the reason why KAT mothers died is because AMerica will never be united. America's culture is like a thrid world country tbh. It's honestly sad. Feel bad for good Americans like me but many want to play poltiics.	0
Another post on Reddit that praises China and bashes US. China lied about the virus and then just today lied about having it under total control.   They started a huge propaganda effort sending tests and material to many countries which were faulty and had to be returned to China.

It’s a ludicrous statement to say calling it a Chinese virus is racist. It is a Chinese virus. It’s the same bullshit as saying correctly identifying killer bees as Africanized bees is racist.

Something like this was posted last night, and again people are calling him evil when they have zero understanding of what is going on.  Since I’m quarantined and have nothing to do I’ll explain this for everyone:  Depending on the state, servers make anywhere from tipped minimum wage to regular minimum wage, same with bussers. Hosts/hostesses/kitchen employees make minimum wage to that plus a few bucks.  On a typical night, Morton’s (A Landry’s restaurant) staffs like this:   12 Servers/Bartenders @ 3.63 per hour. Average of 7 hours worked each= $305  6 Backservers/Barbacks @ 5.50 per hour. Average of 6 hours worked each= $198   3 Hosts @ 12.75 per hour. Avg 5 hours= $191  12 Kitchen Employees @ 15 per hour 7 hours worked each= $1260  So on my low staffing estimate we have just under $2000 per day. This is without adjusting the pay to meet the minimum wage, which would have to happen for tipped employees because obviously they aren’t getting tips right now.   Even without that adjustment, over his 500+ restaurants Fertitta would be spending $1000000 a day just on paying his hourly employees their hourly rate. There are plenty of other operating costs on top of this.  These employees are eligible for unemployment. Sure it’s not what they normally make but it’s enough to get by with the bare minimum. I would know I’m doing it right now.  Any questions? I have a nap scheduled for 3 but besides that my day is pretty wide open	1

>When you have made 300 million dollars off of playing alone (sans endorsements), another 35 million won't really change what you can do, but it could help win a title and keep you in a place you enjoy playing.  I think this way about my job. It would take a huge offer for me to want to take more responsibility and work more hours. I have enough for basically anything I want, so free time is more valuable to me than money. NBA players have plenty of free time, so winning or fame might become the biggest factor for them.	0

Reggie Miller. I can't believe nobody has mentioned him yet. Dude was one of the first I ever saw doing it as a shooter and getting far in the playoffs. He dared to even get to the NBA Finals and hang 2 games up on Shaq and Kobe at the beginning of their 3 peat. One of the few who pushed Jordan to 7 games in a series. I'm not sure that anyone besides Detroit did that. In an era dominated by big centers and forwards, he was the first straight up shooter type to be winning 50-60+ games with his shooting style being the dominant threat. He was a tough SOB too and I think he'd tear this league up right now. He was always a playoff performer and is one of the few that turned up his play in the playoffs. He didn't average 40ppg like MJ did, but Reggie had a playoff gear where other guys just simply did not.	0

Doubt you will look into this, you'll probably just keep your head in the sand. 2009, 4g roll out. Swine Flu outbreak. 3g rolled out in 2001 - SARS outbreak 2002. Radio towers massively rolled out. Radio towers massively rolled out in 1910 - Spanish Flu outbreak in 1912.   5G rolled out....first in Wuhan China. 2nd in Spain. Third in Italy. Then the US (major port cities..NY, LA, Seattle).   Do you see a pattern? It may be nothing, but it is absolutely a pattern worth looking at.  The WHO seems radio frequency radiation as carcinogenic.  5G is used in WEAPON SYSTEMS for crowd control. 5G Network Uses Same EMF Waves As Pentagon Crowd Control System. ...

fair enough, that makes sense. I’m just never sure how to define what “transitioning” truly means when it can mean a number of different things to people. That definitely makes sense though   Going back to my original comment, I wasn’t trying to speak on what is/isn’t appropriate/complicated/acceptable for trans people. Just that, I feel like the majority of people have a much more difficult time being able to accept trans people as opposed to being accepting of gay/bi people. Probably because it’s a more complicated issue in the eye of the public   Hope I worded that well enough	1
Or you are from a country that has been destroyed by interventionist US foreign policy. Or you want to have a future where the planet is not a burning husk of rubble. Or you're a woman who doesn't want to have to work multiple jobs and raise children with no recourse because they are 'equal' to men. Or you're a gay man in Greece or Rome, or a woman in a pre-neolithic society.  See? The woke narrative really only applies to America, starting around the turn of the century. But yes, for straight white men such as myself, the past was also unquestionably better by certain metrics. Probably much worse by others.	0

At the end of the day. This is a Chinese virus that originated in China. Calling it Covid 19 or corona virus or whatever won’t actually stop the racism against Asians. It’s a very simplistic way to look at things, almost how a child would look at it to think otherwise. We could literally call this virus “birthday cake” and wherever it originated from, people would be ostracized from that area. It’s not just white People doing this. It’s every culture. It’s how humanity survived thousands of years of evolution. Whenever there is a threat to the populous we always take a negative view against the threat and where it comes from. It’s basic fucking psycholog honestly. But hey you want to virtue signal how morally fucking superior you think you are be my guest. Just don’t piss in my face and tell me it’s raining	0

That’s way too low of an estimate. Tyson Fury is shorter than LeBron (Bron is 6’8.5” barefoot. Tyson is listed at 6’9” but he’s more like 6’7”-6’”8 based on pictures. [See this thread](https://forums.sherdog.com/threads/tyson-fury-real-height-dwarfed-by-magic-johnson.3961119/)).Tyson Weighed in at 273 lbs for the wilder fight. Muscle weighs more than fat and Bron for sure has much more muscle than Fury. Fury has a decent amount of fat on him.  Long winded way of saying I would bet LeBron is 270 lbs, at least.	1

Because the dudes extremely racist towards asians  Edit:  really downvoted?  On February 28, 2001, an Asian American Golden State Warriors’ fan named Michael Ching shouted at Jason (who was playing for the Sacramento Kings) to “get used to sitting on the bench.” However, the third-year NBA player lashed back with immensely inappropriate and racist comments, including, “I’ll shoot all you Asian mother——-. Do you remember the Vietnam War? I’ll shoot all ya’ll like that.” That is after asking Ching if he was a “fag” and calling him a “slant eyed mother——.”   Asshole literally have to give an public apology for being racist and was fined, but I guess its just ok if its against asians, it is reddit after all so he fits in well here  [Source](https://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/williams-apologizes-for-slurs-1.260572)	0

Unfortunately, no matter how hard a person might *consciously* try to treat every person the same way and avoid prejudice based on appearance, it's impossible to avoid feeling what's been embedded into one's subconscious mind. News, advertisements, films, tv, etc all have a hand in scultping the way we frame the world, and it's difficult to undo all that, all the time. Acknowledging the existence of these *implicit biases* is a great first  step towards undoing them.	1

No. Lebron uses franchises to get what he wants. He's never made one successful. Let's be real. He didn't join the cavs because of Cleveland.  He joined because they had kyrie. A ton of trade assets and no one on the books so he could sign his good friends. I'm so glad it backfired by a team who built in the draft and kd used lebron's tactics against him and I hate the warriors.	0

"> No they don't lol, you don't know what you're talking about  No 5 footers in the last All Star game.   Isaiah Thomas the hero of manlets has already been kicked out of the NBA for being shit.  > Jokic is one of the best passers in the league, leads the league in game winners, and is already the best passing center of all time.  There are 3 billion 5 footers in the world and you are going to tell me that not a single one of them is better than that bum?  Very easy to pass the ball when you see everyone from above and it's hard as fuck to block you because you are 7 foot tall.  >  Thon Maker is a good example. He is athletic and is said to have a great work ethic by everyone, but he's mediocre.  Quick Google search: ""When he was 14, Maker was discovered by Edward Smith...   At first, Maker was reluctant to leave the soccer field behind to focus on organized basketball... At that time Thon was spending his time playing soccer, and had never played basketball a day in his life.""  ""I said no, not because of him, but just I didn’t want to play basketball,"" Maker explained. ""But after trusting in him and going along with the plan, he said, 'Trust me, trust me.'""   Another case of a Soccer reject being told to pursue a Basketball career because Basketball is easy money for very tall dudes... Holy shit there are many many cases of lazy very tall people choosing Basketball for easy money.  Thon Maker is a lazy dude, he couldn't make it in soccer, a sport where you can make a decent living in thousands of teams (each team has like 22 players)... Yet, he quit and switched to Basketball at the age of 14 and is earning millions in the NBA already even if he doesn't give a fuck about the sport.  > The reason the other antetokounmpo brothers have contracts is so teams can lure in Giannis.  The NBA is the dumbest shit ever haha.  > By the way, Giannis is known for having a crazy work ethic lol.  A European Soccer reject has crazy work ethic... Holy shit, if you think a bum like him has work ethic then that explains why the US sucks at European sports like Rugby and Soccer. You have no idea what work ethic means mate.  > you also need to understand that even soccer players require a lot of natural talent. Every single sport requires natural talent and athleticism to compete at the top. Messi is insanely quick and coordinated. Ronaldo is one of the most athletic guys on the planet. Basketball isn't much different.  That's insulting, you will never see rejects form other sports making it to the top of Soccer, let alone reject from other sports that were developed by countries with no soccer infrastructure.  Messi and Ronaldo started to play Soccer at age 4 and worked their assess off, they left their families behind at the age of 11 to go the Barcelona academy (Messi) and Sporting Lisbon (Ronaldo), that's work ethic... They are at the top because of hard work, Messi and Ronaldo are not gifted athletes, Messi looks like a retard and Ronaldo looked like this at the age of 18 [before and after](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/huUuBVRPTKk/maxresdefault.jpg)  It's insulting to compare Giannis, a soccer reject who switched to Basketball late in life to make easy money with Messi and Ronaldo, the hardest workers in sports.  Basketball is based on being tall, sports like soccer are based on hard work, skills and sports IQ."	0

This whole post is fucking retarded man. I’m honestly envious at your willingness to continue arguing this point.  “cars, clothes, **food** and all the other shit they flaunt on their instagrams.” I can’t tell whether this is racist or ignorant or both. Fuck them for having food right? Are you paying money to your boss during this trying time? The thought of me paying the owner of my company money that I deserve just to save them having to spend it is incomprehensible at best. Please give me some reason why you think that billionaire owners should be more entitled to this money than millionaire players. I can’t fathom one reason that isn’t “the owners look more like me.” I’m trying to but I really can’t.	0

As a UK based fan I’ve only seen a few games but I saw Dame drop an ice cold dagger at MSG on New Years Day 2013 which was dope, and I’ve loved him ever since. Was also Amare’s first game of the year and Melo dropped 40-something - I was 14 and it was my first experience of NBA basketball and it was so damn good	0

Having over 2 million dollars at 78 when he's worked in the house and Congress for the past 30 years making $174k a year doesn't mean that he's a hypocrite for advocating policies on the extremely wealthy (avg net worth of 70-79 yr olds in this country is 1.1 mil btw) and trying to push policies that benefit the most hard done in society, like his policy isn't that no one should have a million dollars just that people that make over 10 mil a year should pay more taxes and people sitting on billions of dollars should pay a wealth tax bc no one needs that much money. And the 3 houses shit is one of the dumbest talking points around, he inherited one from his dead mom, he owns a house in an inexpensive area that like isn't particularly nice and has a one bedroom apartment in DC that he's needed for his job for the past 30 years lol	0

All the curry  kids are well grounded. Seth doesnt even allow his wife to sit courtside because he doesnt want her to be looked at as being priviledged. Their parents did a great job and their mom was very strict from what i heard. You dont do your chores, you dont play even if u are the best player on the team. Thats how it goes. You use curse words, you are grounded.. He said his dad was very humble and down to earth and all he did is emulate his dad. His dad was a role player. Curry is basically a superstar with a role player's humility. Thats why he doesnt get angry when the wild animal draymond is barking at him. I kind feel he should transform to westbrook for a minute and destroy draymond's ego but curry is just graceful	0

Read on if you feel called (warning: wall of text). If not then just ignore as you might think I’m throwing propaganda around.  I don’t mean to be insensitive, I only wish to speak the hard truth. Today is a serious reminder that life comes to an end. We are immoral. We can accumulate the world and yet we still leave this earth with nothing. Even Mamba.  I just want to encourage anyone who is dumbstruck, hurt, or confused, to know that there is a God who loves you, and that life truly is fleeting. We are here (quite literally) for a blip of time. There’s way more to life than this short amount of time. Accepting Jesus into your heart changes everything. You begin to have a purpose that’s way bigger than anything here on earth; only because you can take that purpose with you beyond this life. I would love to talk more about my transformation - I’m no perfect Christian, I’m a big sinner, but life has so much more joy and meaning - even in despair like this. Please feel free to reach out if you want to talk more. Even if it’s an educated debate. I’m cool with it.	1

Now they're saying its a flat note	1
A) If you think being financially motivated is something that's exclusive to NBA players, you aren't paying attention. NFL players literally refuse to report to their team's training camp or practices if their contract demands aren't met. Le'Veon Bell literally sat out a whole season because the Steelers wouldn't give him the contract he wanted.     B) What happened in last year's FIBA tournament is not indicative of what will happen in the Olympics at all. That was literally the USA's C-team because of all the guys that rejected invitations. Kemba Walker was the best player on the team and you could argue he's not even a top 5 American at his position.   C) What coaches even talk about Trump or politics besides Pop & Kerr? Are Brad Stevens, Mike D'Antoni, Alvin Gentry, etc. holding political discourse during their press conferences that I seem to be missing? And even then, Pop & Kerr only talk about that a small percentage of the time, but I guess the number could seem greater if their comments trigger you.	1

It's wierd how instead of addressing any of his specific points you took a bunch of wierd shots at mystery commentors  &#x200B;  > Because a lot of the people that worship analytics   *worship?* Huh? You've figured out how much they weigh these how?  > never actually played at at least a JV level to really understand the nuances of the sport   How do you know how much they've played? And more importantly, why do you need to play JV  basketball to understand the nuances of the sport? Surely if their analysis is so bad, you'd be able to rebut it.  > you gotta bunch of kids    You know their age how?   > everyone else on the team sucks and that player is a volume scorer.   Ohhh, now I get it. You have zero clue how these analytics work. Many stats ***dont*** get inflated with volume scoring. Some prefer players who score less. Now all of what you've said makes sense. You don't know what you're talking about so you're tryna feel yourself by attacking the credibility of people you feel stupider then.   &#x200B;  It's really simple, if someone doesn't know  enough, then you should be able to take apart their arguments. If you can't, then any questions/assumptions you make about that person is probably just self-projection.	0

He also knew lebron was going to leave and it was smart to not get saddled with a team that was built for lebron that he would fail with. It would create much more talk about how ""he needs lebron, he's nothing but trash without lebron."" It was a good move on his part to get out of there when he did. He had many valid reasons to do so."	0

"[https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/ezytd9/reasons\_that\_john\_paxson\_gar\_forman\_need\_to\_go/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/ezytd9/reasons_that_john_paxson_gar_forman_need_to_go/)  So without further ado, here are my reasons Garpax need to go:  In no particular order  * Cristiano Felicio Contract. He was 25 years old averaging 4 and 4. * Waiving Spencer Dinwiddie in favor of Michael Carter-Williams * Trading Tony Snell for Michael Carter-Williams * Letting Spencer Dinwiddie walk in favor of MCW * John Paxson choking Vinny Del Negro (His own hire), he would later be quoted ""What also disappointed me was that VDN never owned up to making a mistake"" * Fired Scott Skiles on Christmas Eve * Fired Bill Cartwright days after Thanksgiving after giving him mismatched rosters and under-preforming * Overruling This lobbying for Draymond Green to draft Marquis Teague * Refused or failed to take back salary and gather assets preferring to bet on player Development in Jabari Parker & Otto Porter JR * Tyrus Tomas for LaMarcus Aldridge * The biggest free agent signing of their tenure they almost immediately started drama with telling him he was no longer allowed to wear a headband. This policy would appear to be reverted years later w/ no explanation * Interviewed no one for the job of Head Coach but Jim Boylen & hired him. Worse several reporters (For example Vinny Goodwill) have alleged that this was like to have been planned since the summer beforehand. * Blindsided Hoiberg by firing him after showing up expecting to run practice. During his tenure here they fed him a steady stream of their personal projects & mandated them to receive playing time. None of these projects worked out. Examples are Jerian Grant, Cameron Payne, Joffrey Lavergne, Zipser, Felicio, etc. * Leaked that Derrick Rose was healthy to the media putting a ton of pressure on him to return in time for the playoffs & launching a wave of jokes that never really let up * Let Ron Adams go from Thibs Staff angering him & resulting in him going on to be the architect of the Warriors championship defense. He now has 3 rings. * Not trading Pau Gasol in 2015-16 where we would miss the playoffs and he would walk for nothing * Ran such a sloppy situation around Thibs firing that word reached Thibodeau Hoiberg would be his likely replacement while he was still coaching the team. Also serious speculation that this was told to players, undermining his authority as coach. * Thibs even being hired is a win for them right? No, they actually didn't want him. Tom Thibodeau was the recommendation of an outside group hired by Reinsdorf. John Paxson wanted Doug Collins and Gar Forman wanted Mike Brown. * Refused to hire Thibs strength & conditioning coach (Anthony Falsone) in Houston. He would later be hired and win the championship with the San Antonio Spurs in 2013-14. He still serves as their athletic director today. * Escorted Thibs out with security when he was fired. * Overpaid Fred Hoiberg 5 years /25 million and then fired him before it was complete. K.C. Johnson has speculated this is the reason why Jim Boylen remains. As, they don’t want to be paying two coaches not coaching at the same time. * Letting a lot of talent walk for nothing. To avoid the headache of having to defend each and every player in this group I’ll make my case for the best and attach the rest as honorable mentions. Omer Asik is the biggest mistake. We had no backup 5 to replace him and Houston ended up getting an almost lottery pick for him later on so he was definitely moveable if we ever wanted out. Honorable mentions: Deng, Marco, E’Twaun, the Bench mob. * Amnestied Carlos Boozer way too late to be able to matter * Leaked that Kris Dunn apparently wasn’t working hard enough over the summer * Failed to see the writing on the wall and instead of rebuilding committed us to that meaningless three alphas year just to do the same thing in the end. * The entire Doug McDermott situation can be made into like eight bullets and is stupidly controversial among Bulls fans. But I know there will be stans in the comments so I will let them defend Garpax. * Trading 17 & 18 for 11 in the 2013 draft  \*Using #11 to draft Doug Mcderrmott in a good draft.  * Dumping Doug Mcderrmott just two years later for basically nothing. * Were incredibly late to the game of analytics, frequently downplaying its importance. * Kevin O’ Connor speculates that their promising to draft Chandler Hutchison restricted us from doing any draft night trades involving the #22 pick in 2018. Started our rebuild by selling a second- round pick. (We know Jordan Bell isn’t good, that’s never what this was about) * Third largest market in the NBA, paid the luxury tax twice. Traded for OPJ whose making 27 million and has played in 24/78 games available. If his girlfriend is reliable he’s also not a fan of the front office and a free agent in a year. * Horrible medical team. We’re always injured every single year. * Rosters frequently have big holes and they take bizarre steps to fix them. No Small Forward? Jabari. Need a long-term scoring option next to Rose? 33-year-old Rip Hamilton seems like a safe bet. (I love Rip but that doesn’t make it a good signing) Need a solid starting ball-handler & playmaker? Tomas Satorasnky, MCW, Jerian, Rondo seems like the wait maybe nvm. I know that you can’t nail every signing and not even all of these are bad. It’s more that there seems to be consistent gaps between how they evaluate talent & fit and that actually translates to the court. * 5 Playoff Series wins total in a 17-year tenure. * Had a Bulls doctor question Luol Deng about sitting out of games for a broken leg. * Dumped John Salmons and a first & second round pick to chase Lebron and ended up with nothing. * Trading Kirk Hinrich during his farewell tour for basically nothing. * Again, overruling Thibs when he liked Rudy Gobert for Tony Snell * Pulled the QO on David Nwaba for Jabari Parker. I feel like Nwaba while maybe not fantastic on his own fit really well with us. We’ve been a worse team since he left. * Misused Lauri basically his entire time here. Maybe not directly because of this but it’s now being rumored that he wants out. * Traded Taj Gibson in a year we made the playoffs for Cameron Payne & Joffrey Lavergne. * Failing to net any assets at the 2020 trade deadline. * IMO have had serious questions regarding their drafting ability since now Orlando Magic assistant GM left in 2012. * Are alleged to use the media to trash players and coaches by [Van Gundy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I4Y4VyDqrs)  ETA: - Dwade contract  * Couldn't build around Jimmy * Bad player development, everyone is regressing save Zach * Had coaches spy on coaches/players (Randy Brown) * Failed to make Chicago a FA destination * Inherited the prestige Jordan gave us, made us a joke. * Threatening to give Jimmy Butlers minutes to Tony Snell when he refused a contract extension."	0

1. No matter how many times people try to equate LeBron’s move to Miami and KD’s move to GSW, it won’t be remembered as the same.   2. LeBron wasn’t the first to create a superteam. Rockets tried with Pippen/Barkley/Hakeem and the Celtics did with their Big 3.   3. They aren’t meaningful because he literally joined the team that gave him and ass whooping after him choking away 3 opportunities to take his team to the Finals. Just embarrassing and legitimately ruined the league for a few years cause there was no stopping them besides a crazy amount of injuries.	0

Substantiated or not, we shouldn’t be ridiculing him for his personal choices.

The original conversation was about the makeup of the current Lakers team and how they are better suited to play with AD off the floor and not Lebron due to the type of players on their bench. Bringing up ADs past teams has no bearing to the current conversation.   If you think the level of support Lebron had in Cleveland was worse or the same to what AD had, you either have no idea what you’re talking about or you’re extremely biased. Do you know how many all star players AD played with in New Orleans? 0. I’ll let you count up how many Lebron played with. But again that has no relevance to the original topic so you fucked up in your argument. You’re just saying your opinion when you say no team can be built around AD. And that’s a bad opinion if anything. You’re an absolute moron if you think a team can’t be built around a top 5 player, defensive player of the year and mvp candidate. Again do better   I’m not missing anything. You’re just writing shit that’s all lol. And again, no that’s not bad comprehension, that’s just a normal reaction to a huge reach and expecting other people to follow to your flawed logic. Nice try dumb guy lmao	1

No thats nowhere near a realistic portrayal of the situation. This virus kills the old and already sick, for the absolute majority it will be similar to a flu. Mass unemployment and a deep depression is much more dangerous. And your second point is just ridiculous. Tens of millions are living in poverty, and they are barely covered by benefits. Imagine if 50 million more people become unemployed and now will rely on the government for food and housing. Thats the real societal collapse, not a flu that kills the old and frail mostly. Sure the virus will cause many people to need to stay home just like during a regular flu, but after 1-2 weeks those people will have recovered and hopefully have immunity.  You and everyone else here are doing exactly what that guy warned against, which is to buy into the panic and act in stupid emotional ways. The only solution is the vaccine, and no country can stay locked down for more than 3 months.	1

The entire 2016 finals, yes game 7 is fantastic, but starting at the beginning gets you really invested. If you want to get REALLY emotionally involved with Lebron’s championship run then start with 2015 when they lose. Watching him lose in 2015 makes watching them win in 2016 so much better.	0

You can make the argument that his 2011 playoff performance completely shed his reputation as a playoff choker. His career prior to that had seen his team:  - blow a 2-0 lead in the 2006 Finals - lose as the 1-seed in the first round in 2007 (first time that had happened in a best-of-7 series) - lose as the 2-seed in the first round in 2010 (first time that had happened in a best-of-7 series)  If you go back and watch his highlights from that postseason (particularly against the Thunder and Heat), I believe it undid all the damage done from those earlier years.	0

Jordan's legacy would somehow be less if he made it to the Finals in 95 and lost to Hakeem rather than bowing out in the Semi's to the Magic like he did.

If I could chose Everton getting to 3 F.A Cup Finals in a row and winning them all or getting to 7 in a row and winning 4 of them, I know which one I am picking without fucking hesitation mate! Yerrr... We may have lost 3 of them Finals but overall we won 4 and got to 7 straight Cup Finals rather than not even making it to the Final. Don't let this retarded media agenda fool you.	0

Doubt you will look into this, you'll probably just keep your head in the sand. 2009, 4g roll out. Swine Flu outbreak. 3g rolled out in 2001 - SARS outbreak 2002. Radio towers massively rolled out. Radio towers massively rolled out in 1910 - Spanish Flu outbreak in 1912.   5G rolled out....first in Wuhan China. 2nd in Spain. Third in Italy. Then the US (major port cities..NY, LA, Seattle).   Do you see a pattern? It may be nothing, but it is absolutely a pattern worth looking at.  The WHO seems radio frequency radiation as carcinogenic.  5G is used in WEAPON SYSTEMS for crowd control. 5G Network Uses Same EMF Waves As Pentagon Crowd Control System. ... Among the many potential problems with exposure to 5G radio waves are issues with the skin, which is interesting when you consider that this technology is already being used in the military for crowd control purposes.

That’s because dictators aren’t all cartoon villains. Tito, Ho Chi Minh, Castro, Sankara, Lenin, Mao, Napoleon, were all supported by the majority of their people. That’s not to say they agreed with every policy, but they certainly preferred their leader’s regime to whatever came before.   Were they all ultimately beneficial for their country? That’s another discussion. Revolutions are a reaction to immense oppression. For example, any sane person would rather live under the USSR than feudal Russia. But neither are ideal, obviously.	0

This is ridiculous.   Kevin Garnett would talk about your wife, parents getting cancer, people dying.   Kobe Bryant called a ref a fag on national television, cheated on his wife and settled a sexual assault case. He made it up to her with a an 8 million dollar diamond ring.  There are other players that literally tried to kill their coach (Sprewell) that don't get as much shit as D Wade does. Dude has some bad on-court moments but what he has done for representation of fathers, black fathers, gay, trans, and all he has done for Chicago, Miami, and some specific people should far outweigh that.	0

I'm 25 and I like some reaction youtubers. The 2k/basketball community has a lot of those. It's just funny to see retard level takes/opinions/reactions. Makes for good comedy. Flight is one of those you have to take by doses because he says to much retarded shit in every single video.	0
How many teams in the east had Lebron, Wade, Bosh level players in their primes at once to compete with them? What team in the east had lebron, kyrie, kevin love level players at the same time to compete? This guy was running around on super teams beating up on Kemba Walker. His runs are overrated and the finals disparity proved that. Any team could make that run if they cornered 3 top 10 players in the league and put them on the same team at 25 years old. Lol.	0

"Yeah fuck you too. The Yankees and Dodgers are in big markets (NY/LA) and are media darlings. You're only hearing about the Astros now cuz they beat  the Dodgers in the 2017 world series and the Yankees 2 of last 3 years in the ALCS including this year. So it's no coincidence the intial story from the Athletic just popped up out of nowhere during the World Series this year. Here ya go.  Here is the initial report from 2017 about the investigation:  >I have nonetheless concluded that during the 2017 season the Boston Red Sox violated the Regulation quoted above by sending electronic communications from their video replay room to an athletic trainer in the dugout.   https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-rules-on-red-sox-yankees-sign-stealing-and-fines-both-teams/   Here is a recent article highlighting something that wasn't admitted in 2017:  >""Martino noted the Yankees did use their video room from 2015 to 2017 to decode signs, and MLB warned them and the Red Sox during the 2017 season that ""future violations of this type will be subject to more serious sanctions, including the possible loss of draft picks.""  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2871537-report-mlb-not-investigating-yankees-despite-old-alex-cora-carlos-beltran-video  And if you read the recent Manfred report you could find out that many teams already had their video rooms in their dugouts before the Astros got permission by the league tp move theirs to their dugout in 2018."	1
