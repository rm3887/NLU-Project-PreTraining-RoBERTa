That‚Äôs the problem with ranking Russell‚Äôs legitimacy (top 10) Wilt doesn‚Äôt have this problem. Wilt can be placed in any era and he would be a super star on both sides of the ball. Russell was a defensive great but left a lot to be desired on the offensive end, 15 ppg on 44% from the field for his career while Wilt averaged 30 ppg on 54% FG while averaging more boards and has been rumored to be a better shot blocker. On that alone I would have to put Russell behind Shaq	0

>I should have said Lakers instead  That's fair; I pull no punches when it comes to talking about the Lakers but honestly, it's no worse than what I've seen Laker fans say about the Lakers in their own team sub.  And if it makes you feel better, I used to do the same thing to the Warrior fans as well, but they've noticeably disappeared this year.  >no better than someone thinking x is paid by Ballmer.  This is exactly one of them. I've read comments that have mentioned how Kawhi and Collison screwed you guys over. I've read comments about how Ballmer is paying Moe Harkless to not ask for a buyout to prevent him from going to the Lakers. I've read comments about how Ballmer probably paid Collison to lie to the Lakers and trick them into thinking he was coming so they'd make no moves at the deadline.  So if we're just blindly throwing out accusations, might as well join the party.	1

Iam asking you that. Since you brought up an article of a Asian guy getting attacked. I can bring up many more articles of Asian shop owners beating up black women, killing black people and even the large Asian protest to support Peter Liang murdering and unarmed innocent black man. If White People did that, they would get called Nazis or Charlottesville neo Nazi Riot. So why should Black People fight for people like that which shit on the very people whose backs are the reason they got over here in masses post Civil Rights Era. Foundational Black Americans are the main supporters of the Asian films and Asian businesses in America from the 70s to the Present. Yet to have a massively disrespectful protest to support a Asian cop killing an innocent unarmed Black Man, is totally racist and out of line, but yet want to cry racism when White Supremacist turn on them. They have to hold their own pair on this. Trump is going to do what he has to do. Stop looking at us Foundational Black Americans to fight your battles when none of them come to respect ours.	0

Yeah but Kawhi just being there off the ball is such an offensive threat that people can finally recognize why players like him, Durant, Kobe and Jordan are so good, without them you can still have a full offense that will run well. If Harden or LeBron had a bad 4th quarter then the entire team would have done bad because they are the entire offense, they have the ball in their hand all the time and add less off the ball (LeBron because he can‚Äôt shoot as well and Harden for some reason chooses not to). Kawhi literally only took 14 shots in 4 fourth quarters COMBINED like you said which is absolutely nothing- even if he missed all those shots they barely hurt the offense because even though he missed most of his shots he barely took any. At least when he‚Äôs not shooting the ball, his all star point guard can facilitate and the entire team at least has the chance to ball without him. Imagine a pass first point guard like Lowry playing with LeBron lol he would not have the series he had because he simply wouldn‚Äôt get the touches and wouldn‚Äôt have the same options when he has the ball in his hand. If Kawhi had that same percentage on more shots then it would be a different story and if they lost. Not to mention when he actually does get the ball, the other team doubled him way more than they do LeBron (but not as much as Harden) so even if he‚Äôs not getting the points and assists, he‚Äôs changing the shape of the defense in a way that helps him team tremendously. I know everyone won‚Äôt share the same opinions but I think it‚Äôs a testament to Kawhis greatness that he can take his foot off the brakes and still see his team do well only because I rarely ever see that from high usage guards like LeBron and Harden.   I‚Äôm only talking about LeBron and Harden because you mentioned them not because I hate them but you understand my point.  TL;DR he‚Äôs not criticized because Kawhi helps his team win even when he‚Äôs not putting up the stats.	0

">""You look amazing"", said Mitchell, hands on his skinny jeans that barely skim his butt cheeks. Only Donovan could pull off something that sexy and still look classy. ""Come on, let's dance"", said Gobert, pulling Mitchell over to a minuscule space directly in front of his line of vision. ""You're a great dancer"", said Gobert in gruff tones, ""Champagne?"", Donovan pretends to hesitate ""Of course"" he says. Gobert takes Mitchell's hand and walks up to his room, where an ice bucket and a bottle of Laurent Perrier await. He pours out some glasses, toasting ""To the most beautiful shooting guard in the room"". The truth is, Donovan is more than happy to keep flirting; he is incredibly attracted to Gobert, with his intense brown eyes and his ripped body. Mitchell lets out a sigh that's completely genuine, as Gobert pushes him into the bed, he notices four wide, black silk ribbons are tied to the bed frame. Gobert leans down and kisses Mitchell, his lightly stubbled cheek brushing against Donovan's nipples. He takes the right nipple in his hand and rubs it under his thumb as he bites down gently, teasingly."	1

Nike was selling Lebron more than an athlete merch, and a bunch of their more than an athlete ads said ‚Äústand up for something, even if it means losing everything‚Äù  > a lot of people feeling righteous from a distance might be more like Lebron than they'd hope in a similar situation.  But most of them wouldn‚Äôt have pushed a fake more than an athlete brand beforehand, and thus wouldn‚Äôt be in this same position  There‚Äôs a reason no one is criticizing the other star players as much as Lebron for the China stuff. Because none of them were profiting off more than athlete merch and doing interviews about how they won‚Äôt shut up and dribble, and then turn around and tell Morey to shut up and dribble  > Maybe expect less from Celebrities? Don't believe ads?  Again you‚Äôre missing the point. It‚Äôs not about people expecting these players to speak out about China. They didn‚Äôt.

Dude, if you think players normally equal their stats from regular season to finals you know jack shit about basketball. The more you talk, the more apparent this becomes.

He was 25 years old averaging 4 and 4. * Waiving Spencer Dinwiddie in favor of Michael Carter-Williams * Trading Tony Snell for Michael Carter-Williams * Letting Spencer Dinwiddie walk in favor of MCW * John Paxson choking Vinny Del Negro (His own hire), he would later be quoted ""What also disappointed me was that VDN never owned up to making a mistake"" * Fired Scott Skiles on Christmas Eve * Fired Bill Cartwright days after Thanksgiving after giving him mismatched rosters and under-preforming * Overruling This lobbying for Draymond Green to draft Marquis Teague * Refused or failed to take back salary and gather assets preferring to bet on player Development in Jabari Parker & Otto Porter JR * Tyrus Tomas for LaMarcus Aldridge * The biggest free agent signing of their tenure they almost immediately started drama with telling him he was no longer allowed to wear a headband. This policy would appear to be reverted years later w/ no explanation * Interviewed no one for the job of Head Coach but Jim Boylen & hired him. Worse several reporters (For example Vinny Goodwill) have alleged that this was like to have been planned since the summer beforehand. * Blindsided Hoiberg by firing him after showing up expecting to run practice. During his tenure here they fed him a steady stream of their personal projects & mandated them to receive playing time. None of these projects worked out. Examples are Jerian Grant, Cameron Payne, Joffrey Lavergne, Zipser, Felicio, etc. * Leaked that Derrick Rose was healthy to the media putting a ton of pressure on him to return in time for the playoffs & launching a wave of jokes that never really let up * Let Ron Adams go from Thibs Staff angering him & resulting in him going on to be the architect of the Warriors championship defense. He now has 3 rings. * Not trading Pau Gasol in 2015-16 where we would miss the playoffs and he would walk for nothing * Ran such a sloppy situation around Thibs firing that word reached Thibodeau Hoiberg would be his likely replacement while he was still coaching the team. Also serious speculation that this was told to players, undermining his authority as coach. * Thibs even being hired is a win for them right? No, they actually didn't want him. Tom Thibodeau was the recommendation of an outside group hired by Reinsdorf. John Paxson wanted Doug Collins and Gar Forman wanted Mike Brown. * Refused to hire Thibs strength & conditioning coach (Anthony Falsone) in Houston. He would later be hired and win the championship with the San Antonio Spurs in 2013-14. He still serves as their athletic director today. * Escorted Thibs out with security when he was fired. * Overpaid Fred Hoiberg 5 years /25 million and then fired him before it was complete. K.C. Johnson has speculated this is the reason why Jim Boylen remains. As, they don‚Äôt want to be paying two coaches not coaching at the same time. * Letting a lot of talent walk for nothing. To avoid the headache of having to defend each and every player in this group I‚Äôll make my case for the best and attach the rest as honorable mentions. Omer Asik is the biggest mistake. We had no backup 5 to replace him and Houston ended up getting an almost lottery pick for him later on so he was definitely moveable if we ever wanted out. Honorable mentions: Deng, Marco, E‚ÄôTwaun, the Bench mob. * Amnestied Carlos Boozer way too late to be able to matter * Leaked that Kris Dunn apparently wasn‚Äôt working hard enough over the summer * Failed to see the writing on the wall and instead of rebuilding committed us to that meaningless three alphas year just to do the same thing in the end. * The entire Doug McDermott situation can be made into like eight bullets and is stupidly controversial among Bulls fans. But I know there will be stans in the comments so I will let them defend Garpax. * Trading 17 & 18 for 11 in the 2013 draft  \*Using #11 to draft Doug Mcderrmott in a good draft.  * Dumping Doug Mcderrmott just two years later for basically nothing. * Were incredibly late to the game of analytics, frequently downplaying its importance. * Kevin O‚Äô Connor speculates that their promising to draft Chandler Hutchison restricted us from doing any draft night trades involving the #22 pick in 2018. Started our rebuild by selling a second- round pick. (We know Jordan Bell isn‚Äôt good, that‚Äôs never what this was about) * Third largest market in the NBA, paid the luxury tax twice. Traded for OPJ whose making 27 million and has played in 24/78 games available. If his girlfriend is reliable he‚Äôs also not a fan of the front office and a free agent in a year. * Horrible medical team. We‚Äôre always injured every single year. * Rosters frequently have big holes and they take bizarre steps to fix them. No Small Forward? Jabari. Need a long-term scoring option next to Rose? 33-year-old Rip Hamilton seems like a safe bet. (I love Rip but that doesn‚Äôt make it a good signing) Need a solid starting ball-handler & playmaker? Tomas Satorasnky, MCW, Jerian, Rondo seems like the wait maybe nvm. I know that you can‚Äôt nail every signing and not even all of these are bad. It‚Äôs more that there seems to be consistent gaps between how they evaluate talent & fit and that actually translates to the court. * 5 Playoff Series wins total in a 17-year tenure. * Had a Bulls doctor question Luol Deng about sitting out of games for a broken leg. * Dumped John Salmons and a first & second round pick to chase Lebron and ended up with nothing. * Trading Kirk Hinrich during his farewell tour for basically nothing. * Again, overruling Thibs when he liked Rudy Gobert for Tony Snell * Pulled the QO on David Nwaba for Jabari Parker. I feel like Nwaba while maybe not fantastic on his own fit really well with us. We‚Äôve been a worse team since he left. * Misused Lauri basically his entire time here. Maybe not directly because of this but it‚Äôs now being rumored that he wants out. * Traded Taj Gibson in a year we made the playoffs for Cameron Payne & Joffrey Lavergne. * Failing to net any assets at the 2020 trade deadline. * IMO have had serious questions regarding their drafting ability since now Orlando Magic assistant GM left in 2012. * Are alleged to use the media to trash players and coaches by [Van Gundy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I4Y4VyDqrs)  ETA: - Dwade contract  * Couldn't build around Jimmy * Bad player development, everyone is regressing save Zach * Had coaches spy on coaches/players (Randy Brown) * Failed to make Chicago a FA destination * Inherited the prestige Jordan gave us, made us a joke. * Threatening to give Jimmy Butlers minutes to Tony Snell when he refused a contract extension."	0

Isaac Okoro, though a lot of ppl have started to catch on. First and foremost he‚Äôs a winner (tough, competitive, fills multiple roles), great defender, underrated passer, plays to his strengths and rarely makes mistakes. Even if he doesn‚Äôt end up being a star he‚Äôs gonna be a plus role player even if he‚Äôs just putting up mediocre numbers. He‚Äôd be the bench player that plays 25mpg and ends up closing games for you  Jalen Smith, lean and mobile 6‚Äô10  3 and D big that can also rebound. Really fits today‚Äôs game. Honestly don‚Äôt know why he‚Äôs so low, might be because this is his second year? Don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs wrong with him besides maybe lacking star upside.  Amar Sylla, basically an ahead of schedule Pascal Siakam. Plays for Real Madrid too so you know he‚Äôs learning the game the right way. Has to clean up his skill level and put on good weight, but I think his versatility is really gonna help get him on the floor	1

Came here to say this. Quite literally all it would take is for a few top players who are entering free agency over the next couple of years to say they would refuse to sign for any team not paying the arena staff and this would be sorted.

I said I haven't done much, and the little research I did pointed to the side effects you mentioned.

Check out the pivotal game 6. LeBron actually had a better game. 41 points on 16/27 vs. his 41 points on 16/30 in game 5. He also scored 18 straight for the Cavs during a crucial 3rd quarter/4th quarter stretch where Klay went supernova and the Warriors cut a 20+ point lead to 7. Kyrie was crazy in game 5, but his impact wasn't anywhere close in game 6 where Draymond returned.	0

I would like to see Duncan carry that horrible Minnesota team for 12 years. Garnett was the reason why fans were coming to T-Wolves' games. Never foget that legendary MVP season in 2004. where Garnett carried T-Wolves to the Conference Finals, and if they got past the Pistons, they would meet Lakers in the Finals, and i believe, become NBA champs. He was so great that even Bill Russell said if Garnett didnt win a ring, he would give him one of his. Luckily Garnett won the ring he deserved in 2008. He even came back to Minnesota to play his last season there. We will never see a player like Garnett ever again. Congrats Kevin, you deserve to be in the HOF	0

But man I was shocked when I read nick nurses comment in regards to stanley at the start of the season this year. Nurse was targeting all of the new players including stanley   (https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2858387-raptors-nick-nurse-offers-critique-of-rondae-hollis-jefferson-stanley-johnson)  During this season ronde seemed to accept his role and learn the defensive schemes of the raptors, which resulted him to play more minutes. But stanley is a better defensive player than a offensive player, and he was criticized that badly by nurse. And never showed any improvement towards nurse that warranted stanley to play more. That shows you that during this season Nick nurse just gave up on Stanley in terms of playing him.	0

Curry played the Blazers for his ‚Äò200‚Äô more minutes....the worst defensive team they‚Äôve faced in their 3 yr run.

"Think about your comment on the Lin thing. Why was Melo so unhappy and vocal about Lin's contract ""being ridiculous"" (in Melo's own words). When has another player so overtly ""counted another mans bread"" and commented on it so negatively?   I am sure that Melo's team made many bad moves that wasn't a ""win a championship"" move (not a difficult assumption has his teams never came close to winning). Has he ever raised such a stink about how another player's contract would be ridiculous and stop his team from winning championships?   The answer is that althought Melo may not have been a terrible teammate overall, he was terrible to Lin. Maybe its because Melo didnt like someone taking his shine, but I would be shocked if race wasn't the main factor."	0

Not sure why included 2pt% and rebs when the difference is negligible.

I think the highest rate is 0.2% for people under the age of 55 and that's only deaths/(confirmed cases) which means that it's way less than that because if you do deaths/(unconfirmed + confirmed + asymptomatic) then the rate can only go down. Consider that Vo, Italy is the only city to test all of their population of 1350 after the first person showed symptoms and they discovered that 103 people already had it but showed 0 signs and felt fine. That means more than 99% of the population may have an opportunity to get it and he completely unaffected.  Initial reports estimated 33% of people are unaffected. A week later they estimated 70-90% of people are unaffected. The only numbers that aren't estimates shows greater than 99% may not be effected by the virus.  We still need to look out for the 1% though.  I'm just stating that the numbers are thankfully in most people's favor.	0

Democratic socialism ‚â† socialism, he literally isn't a true socialist basing your argument around 'well if he was a true socialist' is just really dumb to begin with, like your whole argument is that him being wealthy at 78 discounts all the good he's done for humanity is just batshit. The average net worth of Americans aged 70-79 is 1.1 million he's got 2 million, really not living like some king and it's not mental gymnastics to explain to you how he inherited a home and has a one bedroom apartment to go along with his modest house.   If he wasn't a senator and house representative making the salary that he makes he wouldn't have been able to enact any change at all, and he wrote a book people decided to buy that's about him fighting for political change, doesn't go against anything he believes in, he's fine with people making money he literally just wants rich people to pay more taxes... Like I said he's advocating for extremely wealthy people to pay taxes, for the massively rich to pay their workers a fair and livable wage not 1/40,000 of what they make, for a healthcare system that will be cheaper than our current system costing the average American less while guaranteeing comprehensive coverage for every American while our current system leaves ~80mil Americans underinsured or completely uninsured and has completely reshaped the political discourse of one of two political parties in the us. Look at exit polling in literally every primary so far that shows widespread support for m4a and tell me he hasn't done anything, when soon it will become political necessity for Dems to back a policy that would keep 60k people a year from needlessly dying from lack of healthcare/ unafforable coverage. He's been the leading voice on raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and has succeeded in doing that in a number of states. He's gotten major funding for local community health centers that help the underserved with vital services. He's defended poc lgbtq and women's rights since long before it was a politically viable strategy to do so. He's pushed to stop cuts to social security and succeeded in doing so multiple times, he's fought for funding for the VA so veterans aren't abandoned by the govt they served. All this success in helping people but it's all just self serving and inexcusable for him to work in one of the few jobs that he can push for meaningful reform in bc he's given a good salary to do so??? Democratic socialism isn't about making sure no one is wealthy, it's about making sure those that aren't have sufficient safety nets to keep them from needlessly dying from lack of health coverage, lack of a living wage etc. He's argued against having massive donors backing political campaigns that lead to the wealthy having an undue say on policy, and shown that a grassroots, small donor campaign is viable. He's passed so many amendments that have helped working class people throughout the last 30 years man.  Saying he's contributed basically nothing to society is blatantly false, he might not have succeeded in every one of his efforts, but he's completely changed the political landscape of our country and the fact that he's getting 80+ % support of people 30 and under suggest that his ideas will have a very lasting impact on this country and the world	0

No I am giving the same energy to the Asian Community that the Asian Community gives to Black Americans.               again you never seen Black Community as a collective denigrate the Asian community. In fact Foundational Black Americans been their biggest supporters of Asians since the 1970s since they came over in masses. They set up shop in Black Communities. Their movies back in the day were supported by Black Americans.                             That level of Support has very been reciprocated by the Asian community. Instead the Asian community feel they are Honorary Whites, and perfectly fine with Racism, when its Black People on the other end of it. You have all these people running around talking about Black People need to go spend money at Asian businesses, yet Asians would never spend a dime in a Black Business even if they next door and have the stuff they need. The Asian Community wouldnt even pee on a Black Person if they were on fire. So stop with that nonsense nonexistent comparison. Black Americans historically treated Asians way better than Asians have ever treated Foundational Black Americans.                             >Or let's take those anti-semitic murders/attack in New York committed by Black men and women. I saw, sadly, quite a lot of Black people justifying that. That's fucking horrible.  That guy was an Immigrant first of all. He wasnt even a Foundational Black American. Second of all, that guy identified as Jewish, so how is he Anti Semetic?  Only Whites can be Jews now? Again he was mentally ill. Nobody justify that, nor do we claim that guy. On the other hand, Asians in Masses had protest to justify an Asian officer killing an innocent Black Man. Again show me the Black Community doing that.              >Black racism against Asians(which is very common)       No its not. You clever throwing out a lie and pretending like its equivalent. There are far more cases of Asians attacking Black People. Again you can easily find videos of Asian Shop owners attacking Black Women (one of their main consumer groups BTW). Show me how many White Women get punched and beat up by Asian Men in their Asian Shops.	0

The comments here are strange. The issue isn't about what is or isn't factual. We all know the virus originated in China. The issue is that Trump is making an obvious effort to re-brand the virus. He had been calling it coronaivrus and then suddenly made a pivot after beginning to receive criticism. If the Chinese moniker sticks, it becomes easier to shift blame from the administration and their lackluster (to put it kindly) response. The name change is just step 1 of a public relations strategy.	0

Westbrick is the most toxic team cancer on the court in NBA history, Ruined Melo's career, he was literally an all star the season before he became a thunder all of a sudden cancerbrick and his stans blamed him for all of OKC's failures.   Once oladipo got away from him he immediately became an all star and led his team to the same record as trash's team despite trash having a vastly superior team.  PG demanded a trade when he finally realized how badly he fucked up staying with the overrated trash.  KD left the thunder because of trashbrick and him liking (and later unliking) several tweets and posts on twitter/instagram bashing trash several different times is no coincidence, even his brother was bashing him as well.   There isnt a player that makes star teammates worse than trash and its not even close. How the fuck do you get outplayed by a rookie and lose to a rookie led team that didnt have a single all star in their entire roster in the first round especially when you have 2 HoFers on your team.  If that isnt enough proof to convince you hes a toxic team killing cancer, look at the thunder, immediately got much better the second they traded him, even has a record much better than trash's new team.   Trash is Lucky the season got suspended, harden was looking to be trash's next victim, and oh boy if they lost to okc in the 1st round, i mean trash's career is already buried with a tombstone, but that would be a cherry on top of his career's coffin.	0

It‚Äôs not fake. But it‚Äôs demonstrably a microscopic deal compared to the flu.  China has less than a quarter as many active cases as they had 3-4 weeks ago. They‚Äôre going to end up around 6000 casualties.  Compared to 400,000 to 800,000 flu deaths they‚Äôll have this year.  How are people freaking out about this ???  I live 5km from the Italian border.  Right now, there are about 1/500th as many infected Italians with coronavirus as there are with the flu. 1/500th.  Even if you go by the alarmist estimates of COVID being 10 times as deadly and 3 times as infectious, I‚Äôm still 17 times more likely to catch the flu and die from it if I go to Italy right now as I would be to catch corona and die from that.  I‚Äôll bet ANYONE willing right here, any amount of money they want, that the total confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US won‚Äôt reach 300,000.

The problem is the chain of every other interaction outside of your friend group.   The entire point of social distancing is to reduce R naught which is the reproduction # from initial carrier to everyone else. That's how you flatten the curve.   You and your friend group getting the virus is far down the list of concerns in terms of the impact. It's exposure to everyone else. Basically if everyone treated it the way you are the curve would not flatten.	0

Absolutely. A lot of the top 8th graders in the country are much bigger than most full grown adults. There are 8th graders at like 6‚Äô5.

Alright boys here‚Äôs my two cents. Is calling it the ‚ÄúChinese Virus‚Äù racist? No. Will calling it the ‚ÄúChinese Virus‚Äù cause some morons I‚Äôm on country to lash out at Asian-Americans? More than likely, yes.  I agree with China getting shit for this. They had SARS, then Bird a Flu, and now Corona Virus. It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous that they practically churn out a new epidemic each decade. Even worse, at least from my understanding, the origins are all similar. It always starts inside some unregulated wet or live market.  However, calling it the China Virus will do more harm than good. Unfortunately, some idiot out there will hear ‚ÄúChina Virus‚Äù and likely take it out on innocent Asian-Americans. People are dumb and hateful, and will use any reason they can to get riled up.   I just think looking at it from everyone‚Äôs perspective, the best thing to do would be to call it the coronavirus or whatever. We can still give China shit and keep the virus name neutral.	1

">Do you realize that Eric Holder is the only attorney general that has been held in contempt of congress?

Sadly the Democratic Party isn't a cult like the Republican Party who are more than happy to lie, obfuscate and cover for their cult leader every step of the way.  >And has Bill Barr ever said he was the president wingman?  No, instead he published a bullshit summary of the Meuller Report until enough people lost interest, when he should have released the whole damn thing. Then he redacted the most incriminating parts for Trump in an effort to cover for the Lord Emperor in the name of National Security. Something that has raised the ire of a Federal Judge. If the next AG wanted he could prosecute those actions as obstruction of justice and obstruction of Congress. And that's just the tip of the iceberg with this criminal. But I guess saying ""I'm Obama's wingman"" is totally worse. üôÑ"	0

I think it's just a testament to how out of control it is.   Obviously what everyone wants to happen is they take every precaution they can and the season starts back up again. And another option (that nobody wants) is that the season just ends entirely. But what really really \*cannot\* happen is that they try to restart, they set a date, they even play a couple games... and then somebody gets it and they have to shut down again. That just cannot happen. And the fact that it's already so out of control and we have no real clue when it's going to be in control I think makes people more and more think they'll have to shut things down.	0

"He knew his time in Cleveland was over. They tried to trade him and he knew lebron was most likely on board with those moves that didn't pan out.

He also knew lebron was going to leave and it was smart to not get saddled with a team that was built for lebron that he would fail with. It would create much more talk about how ""he needs lebron, he's nothing but trash without lebron."" It was a good move on his part to get out of there when he did. He had many valid reasons to do so."	0

You can NEVER go on a date and never talk about anything about relationships like everyone does normally all the time. You don't get to participate in life like a normal person.   So to avoid this constant daily harm, everyone is being FORCED to understand that being gay is fine. So I guess you're right in a way.	1

>if we go by just the percentages  stopped reading here  just going by the 3pt% is stupid  42.6% of steph's 3pa last season were off the dribble  81.3% of trae's 3pa this season were off the dribble  68.9% of steph's 3pters last season were assisted  29.8% of trae's 3pters this season were assisted  the average distance of a trae 3pa this season? 27.36 feet  the average distance of a steph 3pa last season? 25.92 feet  im not sure how ANYBODY could watch trae and steph play and think it is appropriate to compare their 3pt percentages directly. it's utterly useless.   disclaimer: i think that steph curry is the best shooter in nba history. that is not up for debate. steph's pull-up 3pt% is higher than trae's, and his 3pt% off of passes is higher than trae's. but *far* too many people directly compare his 3pt% to players like james harden and trae young which makes the gap seem bigger than it is.	0

CCP definitely has their problems, suppression of free speech, etc but non related to COVID19.  &nbsp;  Most Countries (including USA, Canada, Italy, etc), squandered time that they had to act.  Taiwan/Singapore has done a great job according to news articles.  &nbsp;  Some moot points that people brought up with respect to how other countries have responded.  1. China suppressed the Doctor that raised awareness about this. True, this was done at a state level. People have been fired for the suppression. The suppression doesn't affect the time other countries have wasted. 1. China is under reporting numbers. True, but so is every one else. The lack of testing capacity, and the virus being new affected this. We saw (in Feb) how fast this spread in China & the drastic measures they took to curb the spread but other countries just sat idle.   Unclear points against China.  1. Wave 2 numbers are unclear.  Clear points against China  1. The prevention of WHO to give information to Taiwan  This by no means is a complete list of points.  That being said, we need to be careful about the 2nd wave of Corona virus.	0

Actual legal answer.  No.     This is defined as subterfuge.  The act of using deceit in order to achieve a goal.  This applies to all sort of legal issues.  For example you buy a car for $6,000.  You can't just claim the car was a gift to a friend and the $6,000 was another gift to avoid taxes.  It's an obvious sale and you used deceit to circumvent the law.  Very illegal	0

"A homeless person after treatment isn't homeless. Its a person in treatment, living in a halfway home perhaps. If you're imagining a ""bum"" off the streets going to a job interview at mcdonalds then you're only thinking in extremes here and not realistically. There are plenty of people who work in mcdonalds who are in treatment: therapy, 12 step program, rehab, you name it. This would be more of the same.   Furthermore, you have to have a better argument than ""being homeless gives you PTSD"". That's not in official literature and the only people who say that as far as I know are people who aren't medical professionals giving their opinion. aka biased takes on the issue.   Your last paragraph is where your opinion clouds your judgement imo. You start off strong by talking about parking spaces. Read this post from 2 years ago to substantiate your knowledge. Read it. https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/6lvwh4/im_an_architect_in_la_specializing_in_multifamily/.   But, your overall main premise is wrong, and I'll tell you why.   The main problem isn't nimbys and blocking homeless shelters, its not giving people with drug addiction and mental illness treatment FIRST. These are diseases of the mind that CANNOT be treated on your own. You need professional help from experienced medical professionals, preferably in a psychiatric setting. Its the same way you need a heart surgeon to perform a bypass surgery on you. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. That's it, bottom line kind of thing.  If you build all the shelters and affordable housing your heart desires (which will never happen btw because the free market controls these things, not govt initiatives) then it will still be a failure because housing is NOT a treatment for schizophrenia or drug addiction. Its a recipe for disaster to give schizophrenics a free house. They'll think govt spies are outside, meaning they'll never leave the house and suffer from malnutrition because they don't go grocery shopping. Many homeless people in their current state CANNOT TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES. They need professional help first before anything else, and you don't understand this because you're only looking at this from a housing POV, which is a failure of perspective.  I've read articles about formerly homeless people being given these houses and they couldn't pay their bills, keep the house clean, or generally hold their shit together. It was a disaster. This was in the NY/NJ area.   You need to stop thinking in terms of housing and nimbys. Its liberal talking points for people who don't know anything about drug addiction or mental health beyond what they read in headlines, which I think you may fall into. I'm lucky enough to be a medical professional so I know a bit more about this, which is where my POV comes from. I've been involved in a psychiatric hospital (on the treatment side) that treated plenty of homeless people, which is why I know how treatment plans work. Everything I described is what I've seen with my own eyes. If I asked you what % of homeless people have drugs in their tox screens, your first guess would always be under what the actual answer is, for example.   I do not mean to denigrate you. You have a lot of great points here. A lot. And you know what you're talking about. I just fave minor disagreements."	0

Are you asking how to explain it biologically? Cause basically what happens is you start in the womb with two X chromosomes. We all start out female. Then at a certain point in the development we go through a certain process where ducts open and certain hormones are released. Testosterone if you are a boy, estrogen (i think or it might be a different hormone) if you are a girl   But sometimes there are issues with the transformation. And a defect is created where there is an imbalance in the brain biology and body biology leading to an lgbtq person. So yes a gay person is biologically gay. It's just a defect of their body attempting to fit into the male or female role  Ps for anyone who is going to downvote me for explaining this you should know I have actually studied this so if you haven't actually studied this then you can't anger down vote me	1

Don't underestimate the power of a little help on the hip or shoulder, and definitely don't underestimate the official's decision and why he called it.

"Pretty much this.  Put it this way: If I cheated on my wife, was accused of rape and then released a statement saying ""I accept that she thought it wasn't consensual"" pretty sure I'd be out of a job and everyone would hate my guts.

Read on if you feel called (warning: wall of text). If not then just ignore as you might think I‚Äôm throwing propaganda around.  I don‚Äôt mean to be insensitive, I only wish to speak the hard truth. Today is a serious reminder that life comes to an end. We are immoral. We can accumulate the world and yet we still leave this earth with nothing. Even Mamba.  I just want to encourage anyone who is dumbstruck, hurt, or confused, to know that there is a God who loves you, and that life truly is fleeting. We are here (quite literally) for a blip of time. There‚Äôs way more to life than this short amount of time. Accepting Jesus into your heart changes everything. You begin to have a purpose that‚Äôs way bigger than anything here on earth; only because you can take that purpose with you beyond this life. I would love to talk more about my transformation - I‚Äôm no perfect Christian, I‚Äôm a big sinner, but life has so much more joy and meaning - even in despair like this. Please feel free to reach out if you want to talk more. Even if it‚Äôs an educated debate. I‚Äôm cool with it.	1

**How do I work?** First I read as many new comments as I can and turn each one into a list of noun phrases (things like 'raindrop' or 'brown paper package'). Next I pluralize them and run them through an algorithm to determine the number of syllables each noun phrase contains. If I find that your comment contains three noun phrases of 2 syllables each, one noun phrase of 5 syllables, and one noun phrase of 6 syllables I simply insert them into the lyrics and post them back to you! Finding noun phrases, determining syllables counts, and pluralizing words are all very tricky and I often make mistakes!

I definitely think the Mavs defense gets understated often in this conversation, but man. After game 1, there was just this...passiveness about him that's hard to explain.

Birmingham is something like the 43rd biggest TV market in the country, and was the most consistent football TV market (i.e. highest rated) for 16 years in a row. It's a bigger media market than either Memphis or New Orleans, according to Nielsen.  Obviously there's no way to know if that would translate to NBA fandom. But again, there are no major pro sports teams in the market. So there wouldn't be any competition for eyeballs, once football is over.  As for metro size: https://moving.selfstorage.com/largest-metro-areas-without-major-league-sports-teams/  Top 10 isn't bad. Plus it's pretty clear Birmingham is the most sports-obsessed of any of that top 10.  I'm not saying it's a no brainer or anything. Obviously Seattle is the best candidate because the team is already wanted there. But Birmingham is a strong candidate for that second spot just because of the lack of competition by other non-football teams.	0

>CDC estimates 80% of the country gets this thing before it's over. That's 256 million people. 2% of that is over 5 million  This is a huge distortion. The range I've read is from 40% to 70%, and the vast majority of cases are mild (80%).  You do a huge disservice by automatically projecting the worst case scenario.  If Italy is the worse case, the avg age of those that died is in the 80s.   People *need* to go back to work. Millions live paycheck to paycheck - they cannot just not work. Unrest can lead to looting and violence, which can also overload the system.  Again, you have very little life experience to understand the downstream effects.

"> And don't tell me I don't know about economics systems and history lmao... I can guarantee you I'm well more learned on this topic than you.  Oh boy lol  You're an idiot. I was going to respond with some stats to blow your mind, that Michigan in fact is far better in standard of living than the rest of the world, but I am realizing you are probably a troll and just wasting time.   I get you're insecure about your financial future but putting your hands over your ears and yelling ""bIlLiOnAiRrEs bAd"" isn't going to help. At the end of the day hyper capitalism has made improvements that vastly outweigh the negatives that come along with it. Nordic countries, and Canada greatly benefit from a lot of the innovation, and production that happened in the US, by profit seeking individuals. It is not the reserve currency for the rest of the world for no reason. For someone very learned on this topic you seem to not know much at all.   Canadian btw and while I love our healthcare system, I am not retarded enough to ignore the obvious benefits of capitalism and even aggressive capitalism. We directly benefit from their private medical sector where we can benefits from their developments in technology and medicine without any of the R&D costs. Unlike you I at least recognize the benefits of socialism, where your arguments are coming from some deep insecurity where you want to pretend profit seeking motive is fundamentally terrible."	0

"> No they don't lol, you don't know what you're talking about  No 5 footers in the last All Star game.   Isaiah Thomas the hero of manlets has already been kicked out of the NBA for being shit.  > Jokic is one of the best passers in the league, leads the league in game winners, and is already the best passing center of all time.  There are 3 billion 5 footers in the world and you are going to tell me that not a single one of them is better than that bum?  Very easy to pass the ball when you see everyone from above and it's hard as fuck to block you because you are 7 foot tall.  >  Thon Maker is a good example. He is athletic and is said to have a great work ethic by everyone, but he's mediocre.  Quick Google search: ""When he was 14, Maker was discovered by Edward Smith...   At first, Maker was reluctant to leave the soccer field behind to focus on organized basketball... At that time Thon was spending his time playing soccer, and had never played basketball a day in his life.""  ""I said no, not because of him, but just I didn‚Äôt want to play basketball,"" Maker explained. ""But after trusting in him and going along with the plan, he said, 'Trust me, trust me.'""   Another case of a Soccer reject being told to pursue a Basketball career because Basketball is easy money for very tall dudes... Holy shit there are many many cases of lazy very tall people choosing Basketball for easy money.  Thon Maker is a lazy dude, he couldn't make it in soccer, a sport where you can make a decent living in thousands of teams (each team has like 22 players)... Yet, he quit and switched to Basketball at the age of 14 and is earning millions in the NBA already even if he doesn't give a fuck about the sport.  > The reason the other antetokounmpo brothers have contracts is so teams can lure in Giannis.  The NBA is the dumbest shit ever haha.  > By the way, Giannis is known for having a crazy work ethic lol.  A European Soccer reject has crazy work ethic... Holy shit, if you think a bum like him has work ethic then that explains why the US sucks at European sports like Rugby and Soccer. You have no idea what work ethic means mate.  > you also need to understand that even soccer players require a lot of natural talent. Every single sport requires natural talent and athleticism to compete at the top. Messi is insanely quick and coordinated. Ronaldo is one of the most athletic guys on the planet. Basketball isn't much different.  That's insulting, you will never see rejects form other sports making it to the top of Soccer, let alone reject from other sports that were developed by countries with no soccer infrastructure.  Messi and Ronaldo started to play Soccer at age 4 and worked their assess off, they left their families behind at the age of 11 to go the Barcelona academy (Messi) and Sporting Lisbon (Ronaldo), that's work ethic... They are at the top because of hard work, Messi and Ronaldo are not gifted athletes, Messi looks like a retard and Ronaldo looked like this at the age of 18 [before and after](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/huUuBVRPTKk/maxresdefault.jpg)  It's insulting to compare Giannis, a soccer reject who switched to Basketball late in life to make easy money with Messi and Ronaldo, the hardest workers in sports.  Basketball is based on being tall, sports like soccer are based on hard work, skills and sports IQ."	0

There's absolutely no way in hell Gobert should make the All-Star game this year.  There's no way he should be picked ahead of guys like Dame, Mitchell, Jokic, Westbrook, CP3, Booker and Ingram, that's not even mentioning guys that will probably make it, but played less games like PG and KAT.  Rudy is more in the bordeline All-Star category with guys like D-Lo, DeRozan and Aldridge this year.	1

Wade no doubt. This isn‚Äôt even a question. Whoever says KD is fucking retarded and only started watching basketball within the past few years   People forget KD was just a tall James harden before he joined a 73 win team that won a title and made 3 finals without him. His playoff efficiency ALWAYS drastically dipped compared to the regular season and he always had his worse series in the biggest games and moments   KD **WISHES** he could have have the run Dwade had in 2006   Put Dwade on those warriors teams instead of KD and they would have gone 16-0, 16-1 in both of their playoff runs  Put Trevor Ariza on those teams instead of KD and they still win at least 1 title lol that‚Äôs how stacked KDs team was   If this was asked in 2016 it would be overwhelmingly wade. It‚Äôs sad that so many retarded people got duped by KD on golden state thinking he could perform like that in the playoffs on any other team.

he also got called for a 5 second back to the basket violation (first time it's ever been called in a playoff game, much less the finals) and when they dislodged him with their knees (illegal to do that) they weren't calling it. if he got physical they'd call him for an offensive foul  lebron was also called for 20 fouls, the most on the heat and the 2nd most overall to chandler's 24	0

">The end goal is a centrally planned system that allocates land for housing according to need.  So how does this work *in a practical sense?*  One obvious question is how you motivate people/companies to fund improvements to a given location. For example, I recently shelled out a decent amount of money for a number of home improvements. These ranged from ""absolutely necessary (new roof)"" to ""not necessary but contributed to the overall quality of the house (energy efficient water heater, new paint and carpet, etc).   If I don't actually own the land, then why would I ever do that? I mean, if the government can decide tomorrow to allocate my land to someone that they have ""determined"" needs it more, then why would I spend money on any of that stuff? I'd probably even put off the things like a new roof as long as I possibly could because there is nothing saying that I wouldn't get kicked out in a month and forced into another house that also needs a new roof.  I mean, do you not see that as a problem? Or do you have a realistic, practical means of still driving improvements when people don't actually own the shit that they are improving?"	0

Paul George did manage to have a pretty good series despite his injury. So props to him. Westbrook however struggled and it‚Äôs obvious the hand injury was doing him no favors that series. He was a major part of that team and the Thunder had basically lost out on all star level production and instead got a guy that was mostly hurting the team due to his injury.	0

That's certainly an interesting take to have.  Personally I hate the lack of a headphone jack. They did a great job with the airpods but they would still work just as well on a phone with a headphone jack. People that don't want to charge headphones, pay extra, or audiophiles still prefer wired headphones. Now they can't even plug same headphones into laptop or phone without adapters.  While I'm glad I don't have to deal with all the adapters I love what they are doing with the laptop ports. USB-C can do everything the old port could do and more. I can't wait for the day when one cable can be used as a laptop charger, phone charger, and HDMI cable.	0

I'm gonna have a really hot take and expect to be downvoted but where was the panic and the outcry when the swine flu infected 60 million Americans and over 700+ million people worldwide in 2009-10? Where was the suspended seasons due to SARS, Ebola, bird flu, Zika,etc? Yes, I get it. There's no vaccine for COVID-19 but vaccines only help you get better if you get sick, it doesn't prevent you from getting it. The common flu is also more contagious than coronavirus. SARS is twice as contagious and no one here batted an eye when there was a SARS outbreak.  The vast majority of people that have died from COVID-19 are the same at-risk people for regular flu, ie elderly and people with compromised immune and respiratory systems. The weather is going to get warmer in a couple of months and you'll see this virus slowly die out and everything will be back to normal by summer. Count on it. It's a virus. It's not the second coming of the black plague. Take precautions, be safe, and everything will be alright.	1

Out of all the guys you mentioned in the east, ""Jason Kidd, Vince Carter, Antwan Jamison, Caron Butler, Chris Weber, Rasheed Wallace,  Richard Jefferson"" only one of them (Chauncey Billups) made all NBA (3rd team).  The East sucked that year.  The number 1 seeded Pistons were old and only won 53 games.  The top 3 seeds in the West won more games than that.  The fearsome Nets you're talking about finished 41-41.  They were a 6 seed and barely 500.  The Spurs barely escaped a 7 game series with the Suns after some controversial suspensions and then swept the Cavs in a series where it never really felt like the Cavs had a chance.  The East was absolutely weak compared to the West that year.  Lebron was amazing, but the argument that he had a tough road to the finals that year is bullshit."	0

Domainee de la Romanee-Conti is only about 5 acres in size, and its output is so regarded that bottles have a price floor of around $10K. This is compounded by the variability in weather leading to great years (vintages) and bad years. A 2009 Bordeaux will go for hundreds more than a 2008, because '08 had shitty weather.   In reality, it's driven by marketing and hype. Oenological science (winemaking) has advanced to the point where it's hard to get a truly bad vintage. Even an '08 CdR from a good producer is really really good. I've had a 1990 Chave Hermitage and it did not justify the $400 increase in price point over a 2005.   So then it gets driven up by perceived rarity (splitting up estates into smaller and smaller micro-vineyards), hype (marketing, placement at major restaurants), and **points**. For some UNHOLY REASON, the wine world has decided that ratings are directly equivalent to a universal, non-negotiable value of a wine.   There's a 100pt scale, but anything good starts at 86 or so. Great wine starts at 91. Each point from Wine Advocate or Wine Spectator can justify adding another $80-100 to your MSRP. Robert Parker's word is gospel to the lawyers and dentists of the world who have more money than sense.   In reality, Bron is falling into the trap of buying the points and not the wine. Points are given by individual reviewers, who have their own flavor profiles that appeal to them. They are far from the gospel that they are regarded as, but instead are indicators of a single person's enjoyment of a wine. If you like light, nuanced wine, throw Robert Parker out the window, because the man loves flavor bombs. If you like the mineraly, astringent whites of Alsace and Austria, toss Spectator out, because they only like sweet, creamy whites from California.   Sorry for the rant, quarantine has me pounding coffee and writing like a madman.	0

The original conversation was about the makeup of the current Lakers team and how they are better suited to play with AD off the floor and not Lebron due to the type of players on their bench. Bringing up ADs past teams has no bearing to the current conversation.   If you think the level of support Lebron had in Cleveland was worse or the same to what AD had, you either have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about or you‚Äôre extremely biased. Do you know how many all star players AD played with in New Orleans? 0. I‚Äôll let you count up how many Lebron played with. But again that has no relevance to the original topic so you fucked up in your argument. You‚Äôre just saying your opinion when you say no team can be built around AD. And that‚Äôs a bad opinion if anything. You‚Äôre an absolute moron if you think a team can‚Äôt be built around a top 5 player, defensive player of the year and mvp candidate. Again do better   I‚Äôm not missing anything. You‚Äôre just writing shit that‚Äôs all lol.

Curry won his Mvps, scoring title and a championship without kd. His numbers dropped when kd came. You can argue that kd killed curry's dominance and didnt help him. Kd was the beneficiary of curry's dominance. Kd never had a signature playoff series till he went to the warriors. Okc called him Mr unreliable because his numbers dropped in the playoffs. In golden state he became an afterthought because teams were worried about allowing curry to get hot.. Klay haas shot 41.9% 3pt for his career. Without curry, that 3pt % drops to 38%. We all saw draymomd's true value this season. Draymond is only a beneficiary of curry. Put draymond on a team with westbrook and im sure he wont even be in the starting line up in 2 yrs.. Curry is a great shooter from 3pt, midrange, finishing around the rim and the best FT shooter in nba history..Curry finishes around the rim more efficiently than kyrie. Kyrie may be flashy but curry is more efficient..He makes his team mates better. Half of the players he took to the finals last year arent even in the nba anymore..  Hope you understand that curry became an all star and all nba player under mark jackson. Before steve kerr became their coach. Draymond wasnt even a starter then. And also he was supposed to be an all star the year before but was snubbed..Even charles barkley cursed the all star voters out in 2013 for snubbing curry.	0

He touched his head. I don't care how tall Tacko is, if you set up a goal and can't clear it, it's not a perfect score dunk.   In general there is a huge score inflation and a ton of dunks got in the 47-50 range which is stupid, because then the truly great dunks are under scored. If the dunks were put on a more realistic scale, I don't think it's a 50 point dunk.  edit: I think this is the first time I've seen a 100+ point comment marked as controversial.

"> You dont get to decide what someones intent is   Intent doesn't particularly matter in the context of this discussion. I could mistakenly believe that ""faggot"" was a nice term and go around calling my gay friends giant faggots and still be a dumb asshole. Language is collectively determined. The world homo is generally offensive to gay people. If you don't want to be rude to gay people, don't say it. End of discussion.    You can be edgy or offensive for laughs if you want. I certainly am, though not too often regarding homosexuality. But don't throw a fit when someone comes along and points out that it's kind of shitty (even if they can't articulate exactly why all that well).  *edit* I should add, I've known quite a few gay people throughout my life, some of them very close friends, and few of them would be particularly hurt or outraged by hearing ""no homo."" Most likely they would roll their eyes or laugh, depending on the context and who is saying it. They have some of the thickest skin of anyone I've met (not surprising, really). That doesn't mean that if they heard someone who wasn't a friend make this and similar jokes loudly and obnoxiously, they wouldn't step up and tell them to knock it the fuck off as a matter of principle."	1

How do you know that?  It could be. It couldn‚Äôt be. If I had to guess it‚Äôs probably about both the victims and the money. Anything we say is pure speculation tho.	1

The black church has quite a bit to do with it. While it may not have the effect on younger people today as it did 10-15-20 years ago, the church still wields an enormous social power among athletes and their parents.   I recall in 08 how many liberals in CA thought that they would be able to defeat ballot measure 8 banning same sex marriage EASILY due to the aa/hispanic turn out for Obama. But the opposite happened. While many liberal measures went through and the state went heavy for Obama, same sex measures were defeated soundly.	1
Okay I think him getting hate during a rape accusation is a little different. During the latter stages of his career the hate was not there in that way.   I‚Äôm also not speaking on overall criticism. I‚Äôm saying specifically that the people who hate LeBron do so with a deep passion for minuscule reasons, and they make it their life‚Äôs mission to ridicule him. I don‚Äôt see that with Kobe, but I wasn‚Äôt old enough to remember the early 2000s.	0

Doubt you will look into this, you'll probably just keep your head in the sand. 2009, 4g roll out. Swine Flu outbreak. 3g rolled out in 2001 - SARS outbreak 2002. Radio towers massively rolled out. Radio towers massively rolled out in 1910 - Spanish Flu outbreak in 1912.   5G rolled out....first in Wuhan China. 2nd in Spain. Third in Italy. Then the US (major port cities..NY, LA, Seattle).   Do you see a pattern? It may be nothing, but it is absolutely a pattern worth looking at.  The WHO seems radio frequency radiation as carcinogenic.  5G is used in WEAPON SYSTEMS for crowd control. 5G¬†Network Uses Same EMF Waves As Pentagon¬†Crowd Control¬†System. ... Among the many potential problems with exposure to¬†5G¬†radio waves are issues with the skin, which is interesting when you consider that this¬†technology¬†is already being used in the military for¬†crowd control¬†purposes.
