God is good	0
Crazy thing is Lebron is built stronger physicallly than he's ever been but he has lost a bit of his explosiveness. But even when they played head to head in March, it was clear Giannis had an issue with Lebron's strength when they bumped bodies and that almost never happens to Giannis.	0

Not yet, but give him two more years and it won't even be a debate. They play totally different styles. One dominates with his IQ and ability to read the game while DRose was an athletic freak that made for insane highlights.	0

The comments here are strange. The issue isn't about what is or isn't factual. We all know the virus originated in China. The issue is that Trump is making an obvious effort to re-brand the virus. He had been calling it coronaivrus and then suddenly made a pivot after beginning to receive criticism. If the Chinese moniker sticks, it becomes easier to shift blame from the administration and their lackluster (to put it kindly) response. The name change is just step 1 of a public relations strategy.	0

dude was literally in the middle of a FEDERAL CASE because he was gambling illegally at that time and he lied to the NBA about it. they found out when the feds came knocking and MJ had to go to court and testify against his old bookie (taking tons of illegal bets) to save his own ass. his bookie was on trial and he had a lot of MJ's checks that were 6 figure checks. MJ initially said the checks were forged but when under oath he admitted that he had given him teh checks for gambling debts.  THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER LAWYER FOUND DEAD ON A GOLF COURSE WITH ANOTHER 6 FIGURE CHECK FROM MJ IN HIS POCKET. never heard of anything coming from that  another guy wrote a book with proof that he had won $900,000 from MJ via golf.  his dad was just killed and to this day there is no evidence linking either person in jail to the crime.   a book written about the whole thing figures the mob killed his dad because him and MJ were doing shady shit that was fucking them out of money. MJ with his gambling and they thought pops was a drug mule.  his dad was convicted of embezzlement right when MJ was drafted into the NBA, as well  MJ's family is kind of nothing but crooks and gangster-wannabes and that's why he acted the way he did. he wasn't mentally tough and ultra prepared, he was ultra-talented and nothing but a dickhead shyster	0

> lol i'm perfectly aware that that's a heat fan, how does that change what i said  It changes what you said because when you use words like “our team”, you’re saying it from the point of view of a Raptors fan when it wasn’t a Raptors fan saying it.

The original conversation was about the makeup of the current Lakers team and how they are better suited to play with AD off the floor and not Lebron due to the type of players on their bench. Bringing up ADs past teams has no bearing to the current conversation.   If you think the level of support Lebron had in Cleveland was worse or the same to what AD had, you either have no idea what you’re talking about or you’re extremely biased. Do you know how many all star players AD played with in New Orleans? 0. I’ll let you count up how many Lebron played with. But again that has no relevance to the original topic so you fucked up in your argument. You’re just saying your opinion when you say no team can be built around AD. And that’s a bad opinion if anything. You’re an absolute moron if you think a team can’t be built around a top 5 player, defensive player of the year and mvp candidate. Again do better   I’m not missing anything. You’re just writing shit that’s all lol. And again, no that’s not bad comprehension, that’s just a normal reaction to a huge reach and expecting other people to follow to your flawed logic. Nice try dumb guy lmao	1

Jordan's legacy would somehow be less if he made it to the Finals in 95 and lost to Hakeem rather than bowing out in the Semi's to the Magic like he did.

Unpopular opinion (even though he publicly announced his affiliation with slytherin) Kobe Bryant is absolutely a gryffindor - he’s loyal and selfish (both traits of Harry) - he just wants to win, he doesn’t complain about not winning MVPs (like lebron) - he wants to be a great player whatever that means (like Harry)  - he isn’t obsessed with his narrative or how people view him (like harry) - he’s the black Mamba, a snake, that’s the only solid reason for slytherin (he feuded with Shaq and for actually reasonable reasons) that pairing is like if Harry’s sidekick had to be George or Fred	0

Joe Rogan disagrees with y’all lol, I think I’ll value his opinion over the dribble in here. Lebron is arguably the best athlete in the world... faster and stronger at his weight than anyone else in the league, I don’t know much about hockey but if this guy is the same weight and height as lebron as it says I highly doubt anyone in here knows enough to say he’s stronger, let alone waaaay stronger than lebron?? Lebron might be the strongest athlete at his weight not counting bodybuilders. And you seriously believe if they were going to have a Logan Paul vs ksi type showdown where each of them could train for a lil while so the fighting experience would be a even playing field, that lebron wouldn’t have a chance? Y’all clearly smoking crack 😂ffs have y’all seen what that man can do with his body? If he was a mma fighter instead of basketball no one would be surprised if he was the ufc heavyweight champion. Think I’m full of shit? Y’all know who the real ufc heavyweight champion is rn? Another guy from Ohio, stipe miocic, him and lebron support each other and before stipe became a mma fighter and then heavyweight champion, he was just a great d1 baseball player. But with a background in wrestling, great fight iq, and incredible athleticism for his size, he was able to become arguably the best heavyweight fighter we’ve seen so far. (Yes there’s more to it than that, but I see no reason why you’d assume lebron wouldn’t have the same intangibles necessary.)Which technically puts Stipe in the conversation for baddest man to ever live😂and he would have a valid argument to that. Even boxers concede mma is more of a realistic fight, and the baddest man on the planet went from being heavyweight champion boxer in the 90’s (Mike Tyson), to now everyone acknowledging that the ufc heavyweight champion is considered the baddest man. You know what stipe’s thoughts on if lebron did mma were when someone asked him right after he won the belt? Thank god that he doesn’t cuz I’d be out of a job 😂not verbatim but you get the point. I’m a huge fan of ufc and that topic of what sports players in other sports would be good fighters is debated a lot by the Sports analysts , and lebron is easily the athlete that’s brought up the most. Why? Because simply his level of athleticism is uncharted territory in combat sports, that, combined with his very high iq (ask anyone) , skill and agility unprecedented for his size in the nba let alone the ufc,while fighting heavyweights who the majority of which will be smaller than him, slower reflexes, weaker, less durable, less explosive? And trust me, you can’t even rely on being more skilled or fighting more intelligently, he’s the sports player of the decade for more than just his athleticism. Honestly, it would be a foolish bet to assume if this dude did decide to go the mma route when he was a kid, that he wouldn’t be competing against the best of the best, and prolly winning against those niggas too. And even now, if he had even a month training,  with the martial arts he already did(y’all niggas didn’t consider that either did ya?) he would work any 43 year old non professional fighter who wants it😂this dude is supposed to compete against a dude a decade younger than him who if the ages were reversed would prolly still be more athletic than you?😂come on now y’all asking to much of my guy chara, I peeped some of his fights and mans can scrap but he’s already had enough concessions keep him away from bron lol let my man rest his wife prolly going through menapause    https://youtu.be/9viiFzuchoo	0

Kobe and MJ. Both overrated and both media hype. Only relevant cuz they played for big market teams and won 5 and 6 scripted rings. MJ also was in Space Jam but strictly Basketball. MJ would be a no body if Stern didn’t suck him dry. This guy couldn’t even win a playoff series without Pippen yet is the GOAT. Hahaha yikes. That’s why I stopped listening to the media years ago, they are all a bunch of shills and liars. Just like the media has lied about all these players having the virus. Can’t believe people take the NBA media serious. I could prove at least 5 of their stories to be fake news	0

Or, alternatively, Kobe destroyed all good will with Shaq by dragging his name through the mud during Kobe's rape scandal, and destroyed what could have been the greatest franchise of all time because he made it clear he would leave for the Clippers if they didn't let Shaq go.  Kobe ran one of the best players in league history out of town because he couldn't handle being second banana and because he was a nightmare of a human being.  Its all in the story you want to tell.   The Kobe deification on this sub is absolutely insane.  If you're judging toxic locker room behavior, its pretty hard to beat accusing your teammate of squashing sexual assault allegations with payouts in a legal deposition.  And the idea the 2013 Knicks could have won anything is ludicrous.   Melo dragged that team into the second round by force of will alone.   His teammates were Iman Shumpert, JR Smith, Raymond Felton, a 80 year old Marcus Camby, Tyson Chandler on half a leg, and exactly zero useful NBA players other than that.  The fact they were even in that Pacers series shows how amazing Carmelo was at his peak, that team was fucking garbage.  It would (ironically) be like if Dame had taken the Blazers to the second round without Nurkic and Collins this year.	0

Also, you are clearly misrepresenting the other side of the argument.

Literally every other thing in Kobe’s life does not point towards that situation being the way the girl said it was.  No other women have ever had anything to say about him + the story just is really bizarre.  Hate to be that guy but nearly positive she did it for the money not because she was actually afraid for her life at any point nor was she raped.  I hope she feels like shit right now tbh but she’s probably still out spending the money she essentially stole legally from him.  Girls going to hotel rooms and making out etc not expecting things to turn into sex are just outright delusional.  Be more responsible.  Furthermore she “stayed late at work to meet Kobe” she really that big of an NBA fan?  Also talk about unprofessional using your job to meet and solicit a celebrity.	1

Mullin never went deep into the playoffs.  Ewing, Malone, Drexler, Barkley, these were the guys MJ stepped on to win rings.  And whom Magic and Bird stepped on before.  The difference IMO between Barkley and the rest of em, is Barkley felt if he had help like Pippen and PJ, he’d have won the same as MJ.  The Dream Team gave him the chance to demonstrate it.  Drexel matched up head to head with MJ so had no disillusions.	0

LeBron, Giannis, Kawhi, and Harden are top 4. It’s either him or Lillard for the 5 spot but when Steph is back to his former self, he’ll be back in the top 5/4 and there’s the possibility KD is still top 5. He has room to improve but he’s not a definite 5 atm and this is coming from a Lakers fan.	0

"Think about your comment on the Lin thing. Why was Melo so unhappy and vocal about Lin's contract ""being ridiculous"" (in Melo's own words). When has another player so overtly ""counted another mans bread"" and commented on it so negatively?   I am sure that Melo's team made many bad moves that wasn't a ""win a championship"" move (not a difficult assumption has his teams never came close to winning). Has he ever raised such a stink about how another player's contract would be ridiculous and stop his team from winning championships?   The answer is that althought Melo may not have been a terrible teammate overall, he was terrible to Lin. Maybe its because Melo didnt like someone taking his shine, but I would be shocked if race wasn't the main factor."	0

This is the most important comment in this chain. Trans issues, especially where minors are concerned, are still treated with a healthy dose of gay panic and fear-mongering by people who actively want to harm these individuals, and oftentimes talking points get picked up in the swirl of condemnation by well meaning people who aren’t as informed on the issue.  Dwayne wade simply said that he supports and acknowledges his daughters existence. He never went into detail about what that meant, but plenary of people outside of the issue like to fill in the blanks for themselves with the most extreme version of what “support” means.  Also, just as an addendum, hormone blockers can actually be extremely beneficial to adolescent trans people, and many of the supposed “permanent” ramifications are in serious dispute because of the wide range of experiences on them.	1

My goodness! This injustice and evil done to Ibaka by these groups of fake fans will never go unpunished. Ibaka option is to demand trade and leave; that's the only way this his impact will be felt; right now Gasol is riding on Ibaka's impact, as soon as he leaves, he will be exposed again.	1

I'm 20 so I'm just not going to incorporate Wilt or Russell because I cannot properly rank them in any way, they are just all time greats and I will leave it at that.   1. Michael Jordan  2.

Kevin Durant   Kevin Durant in the top 10 I know really bold but I guess a lot of my ranking is based on my lack of knowledge of other all time greats who could easily be higher but I guess I rank how skilled a player or how good they are pretty heavily that is why I have Hakeem very high on my list, higher than a lot of people would have him.	0

He is averaging 29/5/9 on 45/37/85 shooting splits (60% TS) for the whole season. In wins he is averaging 35/5/9 on 53/48/80 shooting split (69.6%!! TS).      He absolutely deserved the starting spot and if you don't think so then I really question how much you've really watched him play.       > They’re bad on offense and defense. The system is designed for him to get points.      This has got to be one of the stupidest statements I have ever seen. He is an elite scorer and an elite playmaker and you're trying to phrase it to say that the Hawks team is only made for him to get counting stats. They aren't a great team so there is only so much he can do but what he is doing has been historic for an individual. I don't know how you can even watch Hawks games and act like he doesn't deserve the starting nod. If he didn't play I doubt the Hawks would even have 5 wins for the year at this stage.	1

I'm not talking about the NBA at all you idiot. I was criticizing a moron who wants to think about when and where basketball needs to be played down the road can the eye of a pandemic that's killing our countrymen putting nurses and doctors at extreme risk with honestly no end in sight at this point. Over three million people have applied for unemployment.  People are out of work losing their jobs & don't know when  or how they're going to be able to support their families again. It's not a priority. And that's what Baron Davis was calling him out for. You want to watch basketball go on YouTube and watch all the classic games subscribe to ESPN Plus if you need your fix so bad. Either now or whenever the f*** it's appropriate to start playing basketball or thinking about that. Now is not the time to be talking about the future of basketball when our present situation is this critical and swiftly approaching FUBAR. FUCK YOU.	0

Imagine how good someone who becomes a star in the NBA was when they were a kid. When what they were doing not only worked, they crushed everyone and people were (correctly) telling them they're going to be a star in the NBA one day.  Now try to 'help' that kid out by telling him to change something that he doesn't want to change. He's going to laugh at you and tell you to go fuck yourself.  That's not the correct response and some kids wont do that, that's how you get LeBron and Steph and Tim Duncan who are so great at fundamentals. They were coachable. But not everyone is like them.	0

>> Sorry but no? More exposure does not mean more cases, just more deaths because hospitals cant handle all those cases.  That's all people care about. You said it yourself, more exposure = more deaths. People want to reduce the number of people that die unnecessary deaths due to Covid19 and the strain on the healthcare system.  If we have to stop playing rec ball for a couple months then so be it. I think any reasonable person can agree that people not dying > people playing recreational basketball.	0

"You are ignoring the historical context. Nobody in America is/was being mistreated for being straight.  When did you go to school? Did you not ever see a feminine guy get harassed for being a ""fag"" or ""faggy""?

Sure I’ll explain. I think the first thing is that bin laden intentionally killed those people through action and trump on the other hand caused more deaths through inaction. Bin Laden made a willful choice to commit those acts. Trump on the other hand didn’t try to kill people he just is an idiot and thought this was just the flu or whatever it is that he thought. I think there’s a big difference between intentional murder and inaction due to ignorance. Almost every president at some point makes decisions that cost lives. I don’t think this means they can be equated to murderers. And I don’t think this means they deserve death..... but just to be clear I really dislike trump and this he’s an idiot and a terrible leader. Just don’t want him to die because of it.	0

1) Basketball is inherently a star-driven sport. 5 guys on the court, 1 player can have a significant enough impact to win the game himself, usually by scoring a lot. 22 players on a football field, and look at who are the most popular, QB’s/WR’s/RB’s, the guys that do the scoring.  2) Football players wear helmets covering their face. Basketball players have their faces shown all the time.  3) Basketball is an international sport, basically just a numbers game at that point in terms of followers. I would reckon that soccer players have more IG followers than American football too.	0

That’s because dictators aren’t all cartoon villains. Tito, Ho Chi Minh, Castro, Sankara, Lenin, Mao, Napoleon, were all supported by the majority of their people. That’s not to say they agreed with every policy, but they certainly preferred their leader’s regime to whatever came before.   Were they all ultimately beneficial for their country? That’s another discussion. Revolutions are a reaction to immense oppression. For example, any sane person would rather live under the USSR than feudal Russia. But neither are ideal, obviously.	0

Even if you believe the [deliberately and grossly inflated statistics out of Italy](https://swprs.org/a-swiss-doctor-on-covid-19/) which are not even close to representative of reality, even if you believe CoV is a thing, it’s objectively far less deadly that the flu or tuberculosis.

"I tried to explain that to them but they seemed to just nod their heads and then change the subject. It's annoying that they're dismissive, I don't know if they realize that roughly half my male friends are gay. it definitely hurt to hear them say that, but to me it sounded like it was from a place of ignorance not hatred if that makes sense. They specifically called it ""weird"" and weren't as intense as banning it from discussion. I genuinely think they just don't understand it because all they understand is heterosexual relationships. They were also an arranged marriage which reinforces this idea. Being gay in Indian culture just barely started to be socially acceptable and it's all due to western television and entertainment. It'll change with our generation, it already has."	1

"Weak East??  The Cavs sweep the Washington Wizards. Despite Arenas being hurt, that year Caron Butler was all star, and prime Antawn Jamison (20/8 machine being a good shooter even playing the 4)  Won in 6 against prime Vince Carter, prime Jason Kidd and prime Richard Jefferson. Let that sink for a few seconds.   Defeated in 6 the Detroit Pistons... Chris Webber, Antonio Mcdyess, Tayshaun Prince, Rasheed Wallace and Chauncey Billups with one of the best playoffs performances ever, scoring. 29 of the last 30 points of his team against the 2nd best defense in the league.   Weak East...  LeBron averaged 25/8/8 with 2 steals with one of the slowest pace teams in the playoffs.  His second best teammate was Larry Hughes... 11 points per game on 34% shooting. And Ilgauskas, 12/9  And evidently, they lose against prime Duncan, prime Manu and prime Parker (MVP of the finals). That Spurs team had the best coach ever or one of the best in Pops, Defensive especialist Bowen and good and experienced players like Michael Finley Robert Horry.  To put you all in perspective, Michael Finley had the same numbers with better % than Larry Hughes (in theory LeBron's best teammate)   Because I am an old fan and I don't forget.  The Cavs signed Larry Hughes after his best year and Donyell Marshall and people were talking about a ""big 3"". Well... LeBron's supposedly co-star impacted the game same as the Spurs 4th best player..  All of this while playing 45 minutes per game those playoffs"	1

A) If you think being financially motivated is something that's exclusive to NBA players, you aren't paying attention. NFL players literally refuse to report to their team's training camp or practices if their contract demands aren't met. Le'Veon Bell literally sat out a whole season because the Steelers wouldn't give him the contract he wanted.     B) What happened in last year's FIBA tournament is not indicative of what will happen in the Olympics at all. That was literally the USA's C-team because of all the guys that rejected invitations. Kemba Walker was the best player on the team and you could argue he's not even a top 5 American at his position.   C) What coaches even talk about Trump or politics besides Pop & Kerr? Are Brad Stevens, Mike D'Antoni, Alvin Gentry, etc. holding political discourse during their press conferences that I seem to be missing? And even then, Pop & Kerr only talk about that a small percentage of the time, but I guess the number could seem greater if their comments trigger you.	1

It’s glaringly obvious to anyone with anything more than a high school education. If you support Trump after he’s made it blatantly clear he values his re-election hopes over American lives, than you are scum. If all the vile and embarrassing things he’s done so far haven’t been enough, that should be the final straw for anyone with any intelligence. However, you people are a cult and can’t see he’s barreling towards being hands down the worst leader we have ever had	0
>A prime Shaq is better then a 23 year old Jordan.  Put them 1 on 1 and I bet you Jordan beats him. Jordan would score every time against Shaq. Shaq wouldnt against Jordan because of Jordan's defensive prowess. \*better\* is not the right word. More dominant at his position, maybe.	0

shooting 3 aint everything in basketball. this guys defense would be soo overwelming they would have soo many fast break oportunities they would dominate just on that.

Just read your own statement and see who is being racist lol. Fucking hypocritical idiot.  Edit: I know I will get downvoted and that’s fine, but how the fuck is saying white people this and white people that not a racist generalization? I know all about privilege and all of that, but it’s okay to group all white people into the same category (always talking negatively about them). Seems like generalizations of an entire race and how they think are the very things spoken up against by the very people doing the same thing in relation to white people. How the fuck do you not see that? It can’t be not okay to do to some, but okay to do to others. It’s the very concept that people are talking about on this thread when it comes to people not taking Asian racism serious enough. People suck and always have to blame and hate on some race or generation I guess.	0

If you notice, Ibaka's feet are also moving; almost trembling. To the viewer, Sexton looks unsure as to whether or not Ibaka will drive, shoot, or pass since his feet dont show his intentions.

Little did he know that the shaking was just Ibaka trying wiggle his giant cock as everything he wears down there is too tight.

MJ never won a single series as an underdog. he just wasn't a guy who made a bad team good, he made good teams great  look at the retirement period in the mid 90s, they won 55 without him then he came back with a month to go the next season and while they were upset, they went into the playoffs as the title favorites.

Not to get all tinfoil hat here, but this virus didn’t come from some wet market.   There’s a viral engineering lab in Wuhan, and the outbreak began in November, when the bats are hibernating.

Assist to turnover only tells you who makes riskier passes if they have similar passing abilities. Riskier passing isn't always bad if it gets better looks for his teammates get . For example making an easy pass to a teammate right next to you while double teamed and he has a man on him VS. making a much harder pass to a wide open teammate.	0

I never really understood this line of thinking. The poster you’re responding too clearly believes that by his inaction, Trump is responsible for the deaths and illness of many people. Why would he be “just as bad or worse” for wishing him dead? Were the American citizens who wanted Bin Laden dead after 9/11 just as bad or worse as Bin Laden? I can kind of see it as like a situational thing maybe, like ‘Well they have similar indifference about the sanctity of life that could lead them to make the same decisions if the circumstances were flipped.’ I don’t know tho, it’s hard for me to wrap my head around the ethical reasoning you use to come to that conclusion, and I’m totally open to hearing and trying to better understand that line of thinking if you’re willing to explain a bit	0

1. No matter how many times people try to equate LeBron’s move to Miami and KD’s move to GSW, it won’t be remembered as the same.   2. LeBron wasn’t the first to create a superteam. Rockets tried with Pippen/Barkley/Hakeem and the Celtics did with their Big 3.   3. They aren’t meaningful because he literally joined the team that gave him and ass whooping after him choking away 3 opportunities to take his team to the Finals.

Those picks could easily be more valuable than the thunders picks if they tried to contend for the next few years. Nobody has any idea what Houston or the clippers will look like in 3 years it would be supremely retarded to give 4-5 of those up for a very small chance at a championship. Just because nobody looks unbeatable doesn’t mean the thunder would become anywhere near championship favorites with Beal or Holiday. Not to mention you still have to match salaries meaning they’d have to give away a huge piece of the team no matter what.	0

Nike was selling Lebron more than an athlete merch, and a bunch of their more than an athlete ads said “stand up for something, even if it means losing everything”  > a lot of people feeling righteous from a distance might be more like Lebron than they'd hope in a similar situation.  But most of them wouldn’t have pushed a fake more than an athlete brand beforehand, and thus wouldn’t be in this same position  There’s a reason no one is criticizing the other star players as much as Lebron for the China stuff. Because none of them were profiting off more than athlete merch and doing interviews about how they won’t shut up and dribble, and then turn around and tell Morey to shut up and dribble  > Maybe expect less from Celebrities? Don't believe ads?  Again you’re missing the point. It’s not about people expecting these players to speak out about China. They didn’t. Most of the comments at the time were saying “I wouldn’t speak out either”. What they did say was that athletes should shut the fuck up about being activists when they aren’t.	0

Okay I think him getting hate during a rape accusation is a little different. During the latter stages of his career the hate was not there in that way.   I’m also not speaking on overall criticism.

"The link you shared was one guy giving his own opinion. The guy I replied to said it was ""unanimous"". That means everyone thinks it with no dissent. You posting one person's opinion doesn't show universal agreement. Maybe you're not sure what the word ""unanimous"" means? Giannis has been the front runner, but it's still a two person race, and it wouldn't be if everyone agreed there was only one clear choice. I can't explain it to you any more clearly than that. If you're still having trouble with this, then best of luck because I'm done walking you through it."	1

It was my senior year of high school basketball. It was a David Vs Goliath game. We were playing a highly ranked team in the equivalent of our playoffs. We were significantly smaller and had been blown out by them earlier in the season.   Anyways, there was 1.4 on clock and we were down 1. We called a time out and we decided to run the exact same inbound play we had been running the whole game. They had been leaving the short baseline open all game, and we figured they would likely pack the paint. It worked to perfection. We hit the buzzer beater and our entire team ran onto the court. It was a good a day.	0

Reposting from another thread to spread awareness:  Damn.  Not to take away from Jaemal’s embarrassment because I know firsthand how it feels but this really throws back to the time my fucking sister posted our video on her finsta.  I didn’t even wanna go to school the next day cuz everyone already knew (we were 2 grades apart, she was a junior and i was a freshmen)  Prayers go out to Jaemal for this. Shit is embarrassing af and it’s honestly the worst feeling. I’m probably gonna reach out to him to let him know he’s not alone  All in all, let’s respect this man’s mistake and move on from this. It’s extremely embarrassing for your videos to go on public by accident and I really wouldn’t wish it on anyone— celebrity or not and hung or not. Jarmal Murray is a great basketball player and I hope he can be remembered as that rather than someone who’s sex tapes were leaked. It’s actually incredibly embarrassing for the girl as she is facing embarrassment because of the fuckup of another person, in my scenario i can relate to his girl because my sister somehow posted our video because she’s a dumb bitch.	0

So because you played this one guy in one on one that didn't post you up you don't think an NBA player would post up a smaller NBA player in a serious one on one game? Almost every time a smaller player is switched onto a bigger NBA player in a game there is a clear out and a post up. I don't even know how this is up for debate, it's just basic basketball knowledge. The easiest way to score on someone smaller than you is to post them up. If you played against someone that was 6'10 and he didn't post you up then I'm led to believe that either the game wasn't very serious or he knew he was just so much better than you that he didn't need utilize his size in the best way possible. In this game, Jeff Green couldn't afford to try to face up and break Steve Nash off the dribble	1

Tyson lost to Buster Douglas and to Holyfield. People excuse it by saying he didn’t take the Douglas fight seriously and that if he didn’t go to prison he would have beaten Holyfield, but that’s all speculation. A lot of Ali’s biggest fights happened after his boxing license was taken away from him during his prime. By then he’d notably lost a lot of the movement and speed that he had in his prime, but he still managed to beat all the heavyweights of his era. I’m not saying Tyson wasn’t a great fighter, but to me it feels like people overrate him because of the mysticism that surrounded him. Especially Americans.	0

FYI Chetniks are shit heads- they were Serbian nationalists who collaborated with the Nazi occupiers during World War 2.

This new political party was founded after the fall of communism by war criminal Slobodan Milosevic.	0

Check out the pivotal game 6. LeBron actually had a better game. 41 points on 16/27 vs. his 41 points on 16/30 in game 5. He also scored 18 straight for the Cavs during a crucial 3rd quarter/4th quarter stretch where Klay went supernova and the Warriors cut a 20+ point lead to 7. Kyrie was crazy in game 5, but his impact wasn't anywhere close in game 6 where Draymond returned.	0

“My new motto with everything is, What Would Kobe do? He’d want us to focus more on the loss of his daughter. He’d want us to get past differences with our brothers and move on. He’d never want the game to be cancelled or be stopped. He’d want us to keep going! #RIPKOBE🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾”  -Kendrick Perkins, Jan 27 2020	1
A few thoughts while watching the game:  * The defensive intensity was off the charts * Brook Lopez is a beast patrolling the paint - the forays into the paint by Lowry/FVV were absolutely annhilated by him (and as a salty fan: past 3 seconds a lot of times!) * And god does Brook love shitting on the Raps from 3. Also when did Robin start hitting 3s?! * Wow were the starters ice cold. Everyone shat on Ibaka and Lowry in the post-game thread, but FVV was hot garbage too * Not sure why OG didn't play. He was the only starter hitting his shots, and he was holding his own against Giannis pretty damn well * When did Ilyasova stop getting playing time?? * Holy shit Bud does 239048230948240629752093852 subs a game. Is this some kind of strategy to make the game slower and get more rest? It was also one of the longest games I've been to this season. * Giannis had FVV on him multiple times and passed it out - it was kind of weird. * Boucher and RHJ and Matt Thomas brought it. TDii too (though he also started ice cold - 0/5) * Raptors need Bucks-killer Norm in * Middleton is so damn good * Eric Bledsoe looke WAY better than he did in the playoffs vs the Raptors * Marvin Williams was a solid addition * This [image best describes the Raptors yesterday](https://preview.redd.it/pramgghgr6j41.jpg?width=960&auto=webp&s=63402faa16a5a6b630c997ba27ceb76b7e1ca989)   Overall - Raps great D, meh offense (horrible by starters). Bucks fantastic interior D, solid O, and everyone played so unselfishly.  If FVV had hit that three pointer off the steal (which I hated because of how far he was AND how cold he was), that would have made things *crazy*.	1
"Girlfriend sent this to me yesterday lol   > 🤔🤔😯 SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME THIS ISNT SO!!  ( I copied and pasted this blurb ).... This morning, at 4:30AM, our Prime Minister was served a criminal indictment by the US for corporate & financial crimes. Media owners were instructed to historically brainwash everyone that PM has Corona Virus with his wife and that they wont be leaving their house for a while.  >Tom Hanks was arrested 48hrs ago for Pedophilia and he is currently being kept in a Hotel room in Australia refusing to fly back to USA. Next celebrity arrests will be Celion Dion, Madonna, Charley Barkley, Kevin Spacey - all will claim Corona virus infections.  >Italy's airports have been completely shut down as over 80 of Vatican and financial officials have been served same criminal indictments for financial crime, pedophilia, child trafficking and sex abuse.  >United Emirates have completed mass arrests of their own Royal Family & affiliates.  >Convicted Hollywood rapist Harvey Weinstein agreed to a deal in exchange for his testimony against hundreds of top Hollywood celebrities and their involvement in the drug business, pedophilia and child trafficking. Instead of 55 year sentence, he only received 23y sentence. In exchange, he provided testimonies against some of the biggest & most powerful names including Prince Andrew of UK, former president Bill Clinton, former vice president Joe Biden, Tom Hanks, Oprah, Ellen DeGenerous, Quentin Tarantino, Charlie Sheen, Bob Saget, Kevin Spacey, John Travolta, Steven Spielberg, Podesta, NXIVM and PIZZAGATE sex trafficking clubs, and hundreds of more who all were directly involved with Jeffrey Epstein. In exchange of Jeffrey Epstein's testimony, he was allowed to make a deal and have his suicide in prison faked.  >CEOs of some major world corporations have been indicted/arrested and some forced to resign all in the last 30-60 days, such as CEO of NBA, Harley Davidson, Gates Foundation, Intel, McDonald's, Cesar Awards, Vatican Chief of Police, Disney..etc Approximately 700-800 more resignations are coming in the next 3 months.  >Lab-created Corona Virus is a cover up for mass mandatory vaccination agenda, as well a covert US Intelligence operation that the world has ever seen and this mass 158,000 arrest operation will remove & capture the biggest evil & corrupted politicians, celebrities and CEOs including global elites and bankers such as George Soros, UN officials, founders of GRETA INC.  >Trump will win 2020 elections and arrests of former US presidents will occur in early 2021. All major arrests will be covered by media as an accident or conspiracy theory. All arrested individuals will be given ""Rommel Death"" meaning choice between suicide/accidental death in return for assurances that his/her reputation will remain intact, or face criminal trial that would result in public disgrace.  >Some top religious leaders will be arrested or forced to resign, some will get ""Sick"" suddenly. Vatican will be the first and the Pope will be removed in 2020. Production of human extracted Adrenochrome will be revealed and Hollywood and Vatican will be directly responsible for it.  >Coming up there will be a 2 month complete shut down of the worlds most common operations such as schools, stock exchange, some Banks, airports, shipping, travel, events, galas, expos, sport games, sport championships, music award ceremonies, NBA/NHL/Baseball games, ship cruises including food shortage and staged electricity power loss. Gas prices will go down, food costs will go up, insurance will go up, Gold/silver stocks will fall, many corporations will either bankrupt or take a significant financial loss such as whats about to happen to Air Canada, Disney and Coca Cola.

"He is smart. But he gets caught up in pseudoscience from time to time, and has a tendency to state things as fact that simply are not. And occasionally, such as in Talking With Strangers, says rather... atrocious things. Specifically, when he talks about the relationship between alcohol and rape. It is a very, very uncomfortable read. In the book ""Blink"" he basically espouses mind reading in various parts.   He's a very bright guy, but he loves to play to the new age-y nonsense crowd. He has some legitimate ideas, and he does a good job popularizing a number of social science ideas, it's just interlaced with bullshit. Which makes it kind of super frustrating.  So yeah, you didn't get the wrong impression of him. He's just got a lot of problems, and shouldn't really be taken at face value. He LOVES to speak about things as known or concrete even when the evidence is flimsy at best.   But again, he also popularizes a lot of things, and gets people interested in social science stuff to begin with, which has its benefits. So yeah. He's no the devil or anything, he's just not really a real source for knowledge. If you read anything he writes, use it as a place to start digging deeper, double check any claim he makes, etc.  Also, he IS a great writer. Dude can weave a really awesome narrative.

"Not even the point. We have seen three different explanations post festum... And then they zeroed it in on one, ""official and according to the rules"". And lmao, holy shit, its you again! 🍻 I wasn't clear enough... The rules say the whistle decides when game goes on and when it doesn't. This wasn't a continuation of the inadverted whistle, it was a change of possession after the inadvertent whistle. This ""shooting motion"" is an excuse that was used before - with different official explanations each time. How can you call a ""continuation play"" after player A goes for a layup, player B blocks the shot, ref whistles(incorrectly = makes a mistake), player C catches the ball and scores a put back... They ""inadvertently"" called a nonexistent basket - and finish the review saying that call was wrong, BUT the basket, that wasn't called during the action, gets confirmed 5 minutes after it was supposedly made - in a shooting motion already? Mavs lost 2 games on the same ""inadvertent call"" BS - buy 2 completely opposite official rullings on an unclear, flawed rule."	1
You can't say Kobe was considered the best in 2006, he was coming off rape shit and he was barely making playoffs losing in the first round   2009-10 sure, earlier than that his reputation was shattered, his team was not good, until 07/08, and in 09/10 LeBron was better, he had just come off the best playoffs of his career in 09 and wining two MVPs, 35/9/7 on insane shooting + the historic series against Boston in those playoffs	0

Put yourself in the shoes of someone like KD, or Spida: no cough, no fever, no congestion, no shortness of breath, no fatigue, no pneumonia, no symptoms. Seems like everything is ok, right? Well, check your privilege right there asshole, because not only did they have to hear from a doctor that they have it which is SUPER SCARY (yikes!), theres also a very good chance that they will also be affected by the guilt forever--knowing that they passed this on to other people who may *also* go on to not develop a cough, fever, congestion, shortness of breath, pneumonia, or any other symptoms. And then THOSE people could pass it on to others, who will again, develop no symptoms. Before you know it, everyone under 70 in this country will be walking around with this not even knowing they have it, while 85 year olds will be dropping dead in the hospital with respiratory diseases and heart problems to the tune of slightly below average flu season numbers. Yeah. Still seem minor to you now? Still think life's ever going to ""return to normal""?

A laughing stock franchise who nobody thought could win a championship drafted a player that people thought wasnt strong enough to play in the nba. Had ankle issues that could have ended his career but miraculously became healthy and became 2 mvps. Won his franchise their first championship in 40yrs. Sacrificed his ego and legacy to welcome another mvp (something kobe would never do) and won 2 more chips. Sacrificing his numbers in the process.. Curry is Golden state warriors..	0

You simply don’t know what you are talking about. I don’t have an agenda, I just know much more than you about that entire NBA era. You’re spewing popular horeshit.

"Bruh I'm with you, the love of the game doesn't mean being loud. Like it kind of wigs me out the European pride in their aggressive and ultra hive mentality fandom as if it's something that has this special exquisite thing that's part of a thing that you don't get if you're not a part of it. Like I've been abroad for years and like British people or whichever group of European people sometimes wave that around like it's significant. It's just eurocentrism, treating something different as if it has meaning because it's European. real basketball culture like Gary Payton or Kevin Garnett trash talking folks into tears and like looking to jump Scotty pippin playing around in Chicago as a kid is something which Americans are connected to even if for most it's very peripheral and when you hear stories about them or hear them talk, like, we get that shit in a way that a non-American just can't. I'd much rather have that than some lame and boring exquisitely ""significant"" and ""special"" loud hive atmosphere.   The phrase grit and grind is a good example, like we emotionally understand that phrase very immediately. Also even the way basketball has changed and shaped our language like ""balling out"" and shit like that."	0

To act like Roy wouldn't put up a fight is absolutely ridiculous. Roy embarassed the light heavyweight division so bad that he had to move up to heavyweight and then dominated the heavyweight champ at the time, who had beaten Evander Holyfield before that.  I think Tyson would've won with both in their primes, simply because you can't make up 40 pounds in the ring like that and Roy was a super middleweight originally for Christ's sake, but to act like he wouldn't be able to do anything is pure fantasy, Roy went years without losing ROUNDS.  In 2003, it's not even a debate, you clearly don't know or ignore how bad Tyson looked against Lennox Lewis and how awful he was at this point of his career compared to his former self, so awful that he got knocked out by Danny fucking Williams.	0

Hayward was a legit All-Star his last year in Utah. He didn't play great last year because he was recovering from an injury but if you look at his level of play now he's definitely capable of performing like a star when his team needs him to. He's only averaging 17 points but he's doing it on 52% from the field and 37% from three. He is sort of being penalized by people for his unselfishness since he isn't putting up star numbers but he's doing exactly what his team needs him to do. He's easily capable of putting up big stats when needed. Just look at his last 3 games.	1

I was going to respond to one of your comments in another thread last night about educating yourself before speaking as if fact, but I refrained from doing so. Now I know for damn sure you're just talking out of your ass.  There is an NBA-specific study out there if you actually look. Most players are at full efficiency 1 year after the surgery. The biggest con is the small chance of re-injury, but there have been plenty that have not.   FYI... some guy named Scottie Pippen had the same surgery to start his NBA career. He turned out alright, I think.	1

That's certainly an interesting take to have.  Personally I hate the lack of a headphone jack. They did a great job with the airpods but they would still work just as well on a phone with a headphone jack. People that don't want to charge headphones, pay extra, or audiophiles still prefer wired headphones. Now they can't even plug same headphones into laptop or phone without adapters.  While I'm glad I don't have to deal with all the adapters I love what they are doing with the laptop ports. USB-C can do everything the old port could do and more. I can't wait for the day when one cable can be used as a laptop charger, phone charger, and HDMI cable.	0

What do they do if an outbreak develops while they're at this 'neutral' location?  All you need is for one person to test positive and that'll more than send people into a frenzy. It's not as simple as just quarantining them.  If an NBA player tests positive, it means they've had it at least for 2-14 days (since it seems we're only testing people when exhibiting symptoms) and could've spread it to anyone within that time period. That means family, coaches, teammates, other players - who will all need to be tested now.   The optics of this is absolutely horrible for the NBA - wasting limited test kits so that basketball can finish this season is absurd. And if it's a 'neutral' city that develops an outbreak because the NBA moved there, the perception of the NBA would become worse than the NFL	0

">Do you realize that Eric Holder is the only attorney general that has been held in contempt of congress?  If you are saying 'the democratic Congress has no balls and no teeth' then I agree with you. Sadly the Democratic Party isn't a cult like the Republican Party who are more than happy to lie, obfuscate and cover for their cult leader every step of the way.  >And has Bill Barr ever said he was the president wingman?  No, instead he published a bullshit summary of the Meuller Report until enough people lost interest, when he should have released the whole damn thing. Then he redacted the most incriminating parts for Trump in an effort to cover for the Lord Emperor in the name of National Security. Something that has raised the ire of a Federal Judge. If the next AG wanted he could prosecute those actions as obstruction of justice and obstruction of Congress. And that's just the tip of the iceberg with this criminal.

ethnic breakdown of America  AAPI = 5%.  Hispanics = 16.9%  Blacks = 12.6%  Where are you finding margin of error in this article?  Are you calculating it yourself with what methodology?  And again, I would be more concerned about these support numbers being higher than actual due to response bias.  Similar to how after Trump so many people got the courage to show their true hateful selves.  Another issue would be, who is actually being surveyed?  I would imagine a lot of people wouldnt want to be on these surveys (or cant for some reason), and they would likely not support gay marriage.  Old, language barrier, distrust of survey people, poor (no phone, no computer, too busy)	1

"NHL does have a higher level of acceptance based on polls and imo public player support for LGBT issues.  I think hockey its for different reasons, there seems to be a higher level of acceptance at the pro level but in the minors its way more toxic and overbearing.   Teams matter way more in the NHL (nature of the sport) and anything that's a distraction is bad.  NHL hates celebrations, wants generic answers, focuses on the team, ect.  Its more about not being a ""selfish distraction"".     Big factor I've heard personally is just the insane amount of attention (positive and negative) that you would feel should have nothing to do with your professional life.  Should be a minor thing but the first gay athletes are going to go through media hell on top of general homophobia in the sports, sponsorship issues, not being treated the same, ect."	1

Lebrons teammates screwed him SO HARD at the end of that game. Here’s the final play made by every starter besides Lebron.  Kevin Love - On the play before the Hill free throws the Cavs are winning by 2. Kevin Love makes one of the most disgusting soft fouls ever. Probably the worst foul committed in the history of the Cavs franchise, given what it meant. Steph gets an EASY and 1 to put them up by 1. This foul was literally just as bad as the Ginobili v Dirk foul but nobody remembers it because of what else happened.  George Hill - next play Hill misses the FT. Now I’m not too mad about this because that’s fucking hard to do, making both free throws in that situation. Idc if it’s MJ, KD, Dirk, or anyone in between. Hitting free throws at the end of a finals game is Not easy. That being said he’s still an 80% FT shooter who missed.  JR Smith - didn’t know the score of the game somehow,, and then lied about it, also tried to point the finger at Lebron.  Tristan - tried to start a fight with Draymond  If Lebron didn’t know he was leaving,he knew after that. Literally every starter besides him did something retarded to end that game.	0

For pretext: I live in Canada. The reported China numbers were scary in February (80K). https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china/   Some countries chose not to act, some chose to take some weak measures (e.g. Canada), then there are countries like Taiwan. If 2-3 countries did a good job (e.g. Taiwan and Singapore), other Countries (especially the 1st world countries) have no excuse.  &nbsp;  In Chinese culture, they work to appease their boss, the yes-man culture. In the COVID-19 case, I do think the suppression started on the state level. A bunch of senior state officials got fired, not low level states people. https://www.businessinsider.com/analysis-china-hubei-officials-sacked-xi-jinping-protected-2020-2 Though this doesn't have to be the case all the time. For example, the milk powder suppression during the Beijing Olympics is on the federal level.   &nbsp;  For your next point, on the suppression causing the initial Wuhan out-break. I agree with this. However, given all the factors that we know today & how infectious this disease is, it would have only slowed the spread.	0

No thats nowhere near a realistic portrayal of the situation. This virus kills the old and already sick, for the absolute majority it will be similar to a flu. Mass unemployment and a deep depression is much more dangerous. And your second point is just ridiculous. Tens of millions are living in poverty, and they are barely covered by benefits. Imagine if 50 million more people become unemployed and now will rely on the government for food and housing. Thats the real societal collapse, not a flu that kills the old and frail mostly. Sure the virus will cause many people to need to stay home just like during a regular flu, but after 1-2 weeks those people will have recovered and hopefully have immunity.  You and everyone else here are doing exactly what that guy warned against, which is to buy into the panic and act in stupid emotional ways. The only solution is the vaccine, and no country can stay locked down for more than 3 months.	1

ESPN airs more games with winning teams and NBATV has more of the mediocre teams (Hawks vs Wizards, for example). In terms of analysis NBATV is good. ESPN is good too but you never know what sport they’ll be devoting most of their time on. TNT’s Inside the NBA is my favorite studio show.	0

No I am giving the same energy to the Asian Community that the Asian Community gives to Black Americans.               again you never seen Black Community as a collective denigrate the Asian community. In fact Foundational Black Americans been their biggest supporters of Asians since the 1970s since they came over in masses. They set up shop in Black Communities. Their movies back in the day were supported by Black Americans.                             That level of Support has very been reciprocated by the Asian community. Instead the Asian community feel they are Honorary Whites, and perfectly fine with Racism, when its Black People on the other end of it. You have all these people running around talking about Black People need to go spend money at Asian businesses, yet Asians would never spend a dime in a Black Business even if they next door and have the stuff they need. The Asian Community wouldnt even pee on a Black Person if they were on fire. So stop with that nonsense nonexistent comparison. Black Americans historically treated Asians way better than Asians have ever treated Foundational Black Americans.                             >Or let's take those anti-semitic murders/attack in New York committed by Black men and women. I saw, sadly, quite a lot of Black people justifying that. That's fucking horrible.  That guy was an Immigrant first of all. He wasnt even a Foundational Black American. Second of all, that guy identified as Jewish, so how is he Anti Semetic?  Only Whites can be Jews now? Again he was mentally ill. Nobody justify that, nor do we claim that guy. On the other hand, Asians in Masses had protest to justify an Asian officer killing an innocent Black Man. Again show me the Black Community doing that.              >Black racism against Asians(which is very common)       No its not. You clever throwing out a lie and pretending like its equivalent. There are far more cases of Asians attacking Black People. Again you can easily find videos of Asian Shop owners attacking Black Women (one of their main consumer groups BTW). Show me how many White Women get punched and beat up by Asian Men in their Asian Shops.	0
Isaac Okoro, though a lot of ppl have started to catch on. First and foremost he’s a winner (tough, competitive, fills multiple roles), great defender, underrated passer, plays to his strengths and rarely makes mistakes. Even if he doesn’t end up being a star he’s gonna be a plus role player even if he’s just putting up mediocre numbers. He’d be the bench player that plays 25mpg and ends up closing games for you  Jalen Smith, lean and mobile 6’10  3 and D big that can also rebound. Really fits today’s game. Honestly don’t know why he’s so low, might be because this is his second year? Don’t see what’s wrong with him besides maybe lacking star upside.  Amar Sylla, basically an ahead of schedule Pascal Siakam. Plays for Real Madrid too so you know he’s learning the game the right way. Has to clean up his skill level and put on good weight, but I think his versatility is really gonna help get him on the floor	0

Don't talk about something you obviously know fuck all about.  >Maybe just maybe he actually cares about others opposed to you  When did I say he didn't? What makes you think I don't!

Don’t worry, they’ll literally be fine unless they have preexisting serious medical conditions and are sick anyway. In which case their tragic demises will be due to their other comorbidities but [falsely blamed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/99-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-says) on “coronavirus” to make the headlines scarier for the public.   The “test” for SARS CoV-2 is [admittedly and evidently meaningless](https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/international-news/disease/dr-wolfgang-wodarg-confirms-this-is-an-insane-panic/) and not causally connected to a disease. Your chances of “dying from coronavirus” are, in reality, negligibly small, as in not worth worrying about.   People will downvote me for reassuring you with the truth, but I work at an American hospital and see a **complete lack** of deadly outbreak of any kind every day.  And the truth is starting to leak out if you can ignore the doomsayers long enough to keep your head. As the dust settles on Italy and we see how empty and manipulated their statistics were, “Covid-19” is now no longer even classified as a high consequence infectious disease in the UK.   https://www.gov.uk/guidance/high-consequence-infectious-diseases-hcid	0

This is actually not true. I assume when you say ethnic, you're not referring to black people, and you are Hispanic/Asian.    > Roughly six in ten white (59%), Hispanic (60%), and mixed-race Americans (59%) and close to seven in ten (69%) Asian-Pacific Islander (API) Americans favor same-sex marriage. Black Americans are more divided with fewer than half (48%) expressing support for allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry, while 41% are opposed. However, this represents a five-point increase in support for same-sex marriage, compared to 43% in 2015.  This is from https://www.prri.org/research/americans-views-discrimination-immigrants-blacks-lgbt-sex-marriage-immigration-reform/.  Theoretically speaking gay marriage support isn't a perfect correlation to homophobia, but it's a decent measure. In this case, Asians and Hispanics support gay marriage more than white people, and black people support it decently less than white people, 59% vs 48%, but that's not like some insane margin that would lead me to say that it's much more unpopular among people of color.	1

2011 LeBron playing better obviously results in a 3peat, although people should give the Mavs more credit they were an AWESOME team. But they also could’ve won in 2014 if Wade still had knees and the team outside LeBron performed. I think the real answer is that if they’d been able to get together a couple years sooner they’d have had a higher peak and longer domination. Actual Prime Wade with Prime LeBron.	0

In real life absolutely. In regards to tonight we're gonna blow out these bums	1
Isaac Okoro, though a lot of ppl have started to catch on. First and foremost he’s a winner (tough, competitive, fills multiple roles), great defender, underrated passer, plays to his strengths and rarely makes mistakes. Even if he doesn’t end up being a star he’s gonna be a plus role player even if he’s just putting up mediocre numbers. He’d be the bench player that plays 25mpg and ends up closing games for you  Jalen Smith, lean and mobile 6’10  3 and D big that can also rebound. Really fits today’s game. Honestly don’t know why he’s so low, might be because this is his second year? Don’t see what’s wrong with him besides maybe lacking star upside.  Amar Sylla, basically an ahead of schedule Pascal Siakam. Plays for Real Madrid too so you know he’s learning the game the right way. Has to clean up his skill level and put on good weight, but I think his versatility is really gonna help get him on the floor	1

If LeBron handpicked his teammates he could have picked a hell of a lot better ones. He could’ve joined much better teams than the lakers.   LeBron doesn’t have full control over who gets signed. That’s absurd. He has input sure, but he’s not hand picking who is signed or who teams draft.   And if my aunt had a dick she would be my uncle. Players make fucking shots. That happens. LeBron scored 16 that quarter btw. Which you ignorant fools like to ignore.   Sure let’s say the cavs lose in 2016. Give me all of my hypotheticals and LeBron has a hell of a lot more than 3 rings.

We were gonna go up 3-2. And the league rigged that game to keep the current mvp from getting knocked out by racist owned clippers. Let's be real. Westbrooked fouled the fuck out of cp3. Reggie Jackson got fouled should have been shooting fts.  Cp3 didn't foul Westbrook. Reggie mega fouled cp3 at the end	0

> This seems forced though.   It's a big difference in the overall level of anxiety/privacy/fear one is FORCED to carry. Imagine that you can't let it slip that you have a girlfriend or who you are going on vacation with or who you go home to. You can NEVER go on a date and never talk about anything about relationships like everyone does normally all the time. You don't get to participate in life like a normal person.   So to avoid this constant daily harm, everyone is being FORCED to understand that being gay is fine. So I guess you're right in a way.	1

Lol you played football in the SEC huh? Omg I’m arguing with an autistic 12 year old keyboard warrior troll. You actually told a random reddit stranger that you’ll “take care of them on the court”   How fucking retarded do you have to be to flex that you used to play football in the SEC on the internet. I bet you can bench press like 350 17 times and run a 4.3 40 huh? I bet you’re like 6’8 250 lookin like Lebron James too huh? Are you gonna tell me next that you also have a massive dick?   Also when the fuck did I ever state that I “talk trash” you’re an assuming ass human being you know that?   Now let me get back to my apparent line cutting and toilet paper hoarding and go watch scooby do or whatever it is that 12 yr olds do these days.	0

Man this social distancing must really have you tight if you need to come into a comment section and start an argument. I’m literally providing information for anyone in the comments to see that what is listed isn’t even the highest he’s scored yet. Yet you’re coming in being a dickhead and antagonizing for no reason. Take your negative energy somewhere else. My point still stands, the title is now incorrect and it is not his career high, you cannot disprove that, and therefore I’m done with you. Go let off some steam somewhere else man, you’re clearly pressed.	0

Iam asking you that. Since you brought up an article of a Asian guy getting attacked. I can bring up many more articles of Asian shop owners beating up black women, killing black people and even the large Asian protest to support Peter Liang murdering and unarmed innocent black man. If White People did that, they would get called Nazis or Charlottesville neo Nazi Riot. So why should Black People fight for people like that which shit on the very people whose backs are the reason they got over here in masses post Civil Rights Era. Foundational Black Americans are the main supporters of the Asian films and Asian businesses in America from the 70s to the Present. Yet to have a massively disrespectful protest to support a Asian cop killing an innocent unarmed Black Man, is totally racist and out of line, but yet want to cry racism when White Supremacist turn on them. They have to hold their own pair on this. Trump is going to do what he has to do. Stop looking at us Foundational Black Americans to fight your battles when none of them come to respect ours.	0

EVEN IN A REGULAR GAME WITH ANOTHER VERY GOOD NBA PLAYER ON THAT TEAM THE KNICKS MIGHT JUST GET RANDOMLY LUCKY BUT THEY ARE NOT LOSING 5v4.

An extremely unpopular opinion.  But I think they shouldn't be doing this.  Besides him never being a Maverick, they only decided to do this after his death.

In a perfect world we would be all isolated and in less than a month it would be over yes. Then why are you still playing basketball outside? Do your part.  You think by playing basketball outside you're helping to flatten the curve? What? The more people outside, the higher the chance it is they get infected, hence the number of cases will be higher and it translates into more people in the Hospitals and number of deaths as well.	0

As a Bulls fan I don’t think they have anything that would be good enough to trade for our only good player. Only player on their team better than Zach is Siakam who they obviously would keep and Lowry is too old so I don’t see how a trade would go down other than 1-2 firsts	0
">You have not debunked a single thing in that video. The only thing you proved is that the word soon is technically true if you want to be generous and include that we will have it by next flu season.   I'll keep copying and pasting until you address it.   LMAO okay man. The video is nothing but bullshit. The virus wasn't a big deal in America mid January at that point. No need for revisionist history. Saying that most people will get better is TRUE. Saying that it will likely be over soon is TRUE. Saying there are treatments and vaccines coming soon is TRUE. Like the majority of what he said in there is factually correct. Why can't you understand that? He has taken the measures necessary to get this under control. It's also his job to not fucking spread panic and throw us into anarchy.  Literally a week before Trump said he didn't think it was a pandemic in January the WHO was saying that human to human transmission of the disease was not happening. The entire fucking world wasn't taking it seriously at that point.  >Comparing to regular drugs development is a strawman. His intent was not ""dont worry we will have a vaccine within 12 years""  His intent is that we will have something to fight the virus in the near future. Having a vaccine ready by next flu season is fucking soon man i dont give a fuck what you say. Keep ignoring the fact that therapeutic treatments are available already. Doesn't fit your retarded narrative.  >That was a total of what 5-7 seconds of the video. How about the other 2:05? The video is date stamped, it is not trying to skew what he said, even said there are only 8 cases in America at the time. That does not dismiss the criticism of him saying ""we have shut it down"" while cases were on the rise in January, not does it address the other 95% of the video.  I addressed most of it in my previous comments. Please read slower.  >Your link about test kits having the hiccup (which I cant even read because you linked a website that forces you to create an account) does not dismiss the criticism of him saying ""as of yesterday and today anyone can get a test"" These test production errors occurred in February, it was known at the time we did not have enough tests and he lied about it.  How does it fucking not? Companies preparing and shipping tests tell trump they are ready and how many will be available now and in the future. Trump then says they're available. Then you have the issues come up. Is it that hard to follow dude?  >Now we are on to whataboutisms. I am not a fan of any of the people you have named. I have never voted democrat in my life and am just as critical to them as I am Trump. Wish you were too, but your likely part of the Trump cult who are political hacks who consistently trash the media for being fake news but never Trump who is one of the largest providers of it.  DGAF who you voted for. You would be surprised who I voted for in the past but that's completely irrelevant. Doesn't make your retarded logic any better. It's not whataboutism, it's admitting that the dude isn't perfect but that video is bullshit and is overplaying any apparent mishandling of the virus.   >Please show me where you debunked that Trump did not say cases are going to go down in late February when there were 80K+ cases in the world?  Talking about the vaccines. What he said there was flat out wrong and I already said as such.  >If you reread what I wrote, I specifically said Trump did not say this just that he consistently endorses the people who made those dangerous claims. I said people at Fox went even further than Trump did. I did not say Trump said it was a hoax nor that he praised their specific response to the hoax. The favorite network of the guy who consistently says ""fake news"" were endangering people with their careless reporting on the virus.  Such an absurd way to attempt to attach something to Trump it's not worthy of a response."	0
